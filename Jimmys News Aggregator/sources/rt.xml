                            <p><strong>The UK government has confirmed that the all-important draft texts for the political declaration required to complete a Brexit agreement have been submitted to Brussels for approval, with time running out to seal a deal.</strong></p>
                            <p>During questions by UK lawmakers on the parliamentary select committee on Wednesday, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay revealed that the government had sent the critical documents that outline the future relationship to EU officials.</p>

<p>Barclay also confirmed that PM Boris Johnson will write a letter to the EU on Saturday requesting a delay to Brexit if no deal is agreed at the European Council meeting later this week.</p>
<p>He told MPs that Johnson will <em>&ldquo;comply with the law and comply with undertakings given to the court.&rdquo;</em> Under the terms of the Benn Act, it would mean an extension until January 31, 2020.</p>
<p>However, Barclay was insistent that the UK would be leaving the bloc on October 31 &ndash; the Brexit deadline day &ndash; and would not accept a delay, even to tie up some loose ends on a deal.</p>
<p>Downing Street has been conducting meetings in recent days with their Northern Irish allies in government, the DUP, and members of the hardline Brexit group European Research Group (ERG). Johnson is mindful that their support is critical in any Brexit deal getting through the UK Parliament.</p>

                            <p><strong>Amid street protests in Hong Kong, NBA superstar LeBron James has moved to clarify his comments regarding Houston Rockets GM’s support for Hong Kong in their dispute with China, calling the situation a “tough” one.</strong></p>
                            <p><em>"I mean obviously it's a tough situation that we're all in right now, as an association,"</em> said James.</p>
<p><em>"Us as athletes, owners, GMs, whatever, so forth. I think when the issue comes up, if you feel passionate about it or you feel like it's something that you want to talk about, then so be it."</em></p>
<p>The furor began after Rockets GM Daryl Morey tweeted his support for Hong Kong, saying: <em>"Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong."</em></p>
<p>Morey subsequently deleted the tweet, but the fallout from his public show of support for Hong Kong during a sensitive time between the NBA and China has been a significant one, with the country&rsquo;s state television channel opting not to broadcast the game between the Brooklyn Nets and the LA Lakers, while a number of Chinese companies reportedly suspended their business activities with the NBA.</p>

<p>Morey&rsquo;s boss at Houston, owner Tilman Fertitta, publicly distancing himself from Morey&rsquo;s sentiments, while star player James Harden telling a press conference in Tokyo: <em>"We apologize. You know, we love China. We love playing there."</em></p>
<p>James weighed in via Twitter on Monday following the Lakers&rsquo; tour of China, saying he believed Morey was <em>"either misinformed or not really educated on the situation"</em> and wasn&rsquo;t mindful of the potential consequences arising from his message before he posted it.</p>
<p><em>"So many people could have been harmed not only financially (but) physically, emotionally, spiritually,"</em> he said.</p>
<p><em>"So just be careful what we tweet and say and we do, even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too."</em></p>

<p>After his comments met with a strong response online, he later added: <em>"Let me clear up the confusion. I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of (Morey's) tweet. I'm not discussing the substance. Others can talk about that."</em></p>
<p>James&rsquo; comments prompted an angry response from fans in Hong Kong, who viewed it as a veiled message of support for China, and fans were shown burning and stamping on basketball jerseys bearing his name.</p>

        frameborder="0"></iframe>




<p>But while those images have been widely circulated via social media, James said he hasn&rsquo;t seen them, and isn&rsquo;t following the response to his comments.</p>
<p><em>"I haven't been paying attention to it much besides what I said and what we're trying to do here,"</em> he said.</p>
<p>And, speaking to reporters on Tuesday,&nbsp; James continued on his point about free speech, saying: <em>"I also don't think that every issue should be everybody's problem, as well. There's multiple things that we haven't talked about that happen in our own country that we don't bring up. There's things that happen in my own community.</em></p>
<p><em>"There's issues all over the world, and I think the best thing we can do is, if you feel passionate about it, talk about it. If you don't have a lot of knowledge about it or you don't quite understand it, I don't think you should talk about it. I think it just puts you in a tough position."</em></p>
<p>And with that said, the Lakers star said he would draw a line under the topic in order to keep the focus on basketball for him and his teammates moving forward.</p>
<p><em>"I won't talk about it again, because I'll be cheating my teammates by continuing to harp on something that won't benefit us,"</em> James said.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>It’s that spectacular time of the year again when the Earth passes through the debris field left in the wake of Halley’s Comet and the sky lights up with dozens of shooting stars, known as the Orionids meteor shower.</strong></p>
                            <p><em>&ldquo;I would rank the Orionids in the top five meteor showers of the year,&rdquo;</em> AccuWeather Astronomy Blogger Dave Samuhel said. <em>&ldquo;It will be the strongest shower since the Perseids of August.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Orionids, named after their point of origin in the constellation Orion, are already underway and are due to peak on October 22 and 23 before concluding on November 7. At the height of the celestial display, stargazers can expect to see up to 30 to 40 meteors streaking across the night sky 60 miles up (conditions permitting) at speeds of up to 148,000mph.</p>

            </figure>

<p><strong>How to catch the celestial show</strong></p>
<p>The best chance for visibility will be an hour or two before dawn at 6:55am ET on October 23. Though, more generally, the shower is best viewed after midnight, once Orion is fully visible in the night sky.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The higher in the sky the radiant point is, the higher the rate of meteors per hour. The meteors appear for longer and are more spectacular at around 45 to 90 degrees away from the radiant, so make you sure to adjust your viewing angle if you are braving the early morning cold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As always, experts advise that you get away from the city lights if you can, lie down on flat ground facing the constellation Orion, and head out early (roughly 30 minutes before the peak should do the trick) to give your eyes time to adjust to the darkness.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the show will be somewhat spoiled as it takes place while the Moon is at its brightest. Then there&rsquo;s the inevitable risk of cloud cover. Still, the promise of two dozen meteors per hour should be enough to entice die-hard amateur astronomers out of bed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those who will miss out on the Orionids peak, fear not, as there are four more meteor showers expected to peak in the closing months of 2019, including the Geminids in mid-December, with an expected peak of over 100 meteors per hour.</p>

<p>It explained that the South Asian nation will need to achieve greater resource efficiency as it sustains growth, given its resource endowments and large population. Land must be used more productively in urban areas through the spatial transformation of cities to achieve agglomeration economies, and in rural areas through increased agricultural productivity. Water management will need to prepare for shifting water allocation to higher-value uses and for policies to increase the value of water use within sectors.</p>
<p>The World Bank pointed out that 230 million people are not properly connected to the electricity grid. It said that India's rapidly growing economy needs investment in infrastructure, an estimated 8.8 percent of GDP, or $343 billion a year until 2030.</p>

                        <p>Greece&rsquo;s eastern islands are struggling to cope with a surge in arrivals of migrants and asylum-seekers that has undermined efforts to ease overcrowding at refugee camps.</p>
<p>The number of people reaching Lesbos, Samos, and other Greeks islands in the eastern Aegean Sea is the highest since the EU reached a &euro;6-billion agreement in 2016 to prevent migrants from leaving the coast of Turkey and heading to the EU, AP said.</p>
<p>Dinghies carrying migrants from Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere are reaching the islands despite enhanced patrols by the coast guard, supported by the Greek military, in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The government promised to accelerate transfers to the mainland and expand the network of camps there, but those transfers have so far been outnumbered by new arrivals on the islands.</p>]]>

                        <p>France is calling on European and other members of the coalition fighting Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) in Syria to regroup as the US abdicates its &ldquo;leadership role&rdquo; in the region, AP reports.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian told BFM television on Wednesday that France is notably now looking to Russia, given their &ldquo;common interests&rdquo; in defeating IS in Syria.</p>
<p>The American military withdrawal from northeastern Syria is forcing European leaders to re-examine their alliance with the US in the region, the minister said. France&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;own security is at stake&rdquo;</em> amid the Turkish offensive against Syrian Kurdish fighters, he added.</p>
<p>Le Drian said that <em>&ldquo;to accept this invasion&rdquo;</em> was giving IS<em> &ldquo;an open door&rdquo;</em> to return, as the chaos could allow thousands of IS fighters detained by Kurdish forces to escape.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>An apparent typo turned a serious news update about the relocation of US troops from Syria into a politically loaded joke when TIME magazine said the Americans would be transported to, of all places, Iran.</strong></p>
                            <p>The gaffe happened on Tuesday when the magazine reprinted a piece from AP&rsquo;s live updates, which reported that US troops previously stationed in northeastern Syria would be repositioned to Iraq, Kuwait, and possibly Jordan. TIME <a href="https://time.com/5700683/us-troops-leaving-syria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added</a> its own headline that read: <em>&ldquo;1,000 U.S. Troops Leaving Syria Will Move to Iran and Kuwait.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The mistake has since been corrected, though <a href="https://nonperele.com/1000-u-s-troops-leaving-syria-will-move-to-iran-and-kuwait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some</a> websites that <a href="https://121private.home.blog/2019/10/15/1000-u-s-troops-leaving-syria-will-move-to-iran-and-kuwait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">copy-pasted</a> the story from TIME are still running with it.</p>
<p>Well, America&rsquo;s primary enemy in the Middle East is obviously an unlikely host for its troops. In 2016, when a US boat strayed into Iranian waters, the crew was promptly arrested and sent back hours later &ndash; and those were the more peaceful times of nuclear deal rapprochement.</p>

<p>So, unless TIME has some knowledge about an imminent shooting war between the US and Iran, it&rsquo;s safe to assume it was just a typo, just as the correction under it now says.</p>

                        <p>Yemen&rsquo;s Saudi-backed government and southern separatists are expected on Thursday to announce a deal to end a power struggle over the southern port of Aden, Reuters reports, citing officials. The tension has fractured an Arab coalition battling the Houthi group.</p>
<p>The UAE-backed separatist Southern Transition Council (STC) is nominally allied to the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, but the two sides fell out in August, with the separatists seizing control of Aden.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has hosted indirect talks between them to rebuild the coalition fighting against the Houthi movement that expelled Hadi&rsquo;s government from the capital Sanaa five years ago.</p>
<p>The deal reportedly calls for a government reshuffle to include STC, which seeks self-rule in the south, and the restructuring of armed forces under Saudi supervision.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The US has conducted several cyberwarfare operations against Iran in recent months, including one in retaliation for the September 14 attack on Saudi oil infrastructure, according to Reuters sources.</strong></p>
                            <p>The latest cyber-strike was conducted by the Pentagon sometime in late September and affected physical hardware, two sources <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-military-cyber-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-carried-out-secret-cyber-strike-on-iran-in-wake-of-saudi-oil-attack-officials-say-idUSKBN1WV0EK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> the news agency. The target is related to what the sources described as Tehran&rsquo;s ability to spread <em>&ldquo;propaganda.&rdquo;</em> The operation was said to be smaller in scale than previous ones that took place during several months of US-Iranian brinkmanship.</p>
<p>Washington has a long record of using its cyber-offensive capabilities against Iran. The most famous example was Operation Olympic Games, which involved infecting industrial controllers at an Iranian uranium enrichment plant with a virus designed to damage centrifuges in ostensibly natural malfunctions. The campaign was conducted under the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and was stopped after the virus, called Stuxnet, got out of control and spread across the internet, where it was identified by cybersecurity experts.</p>

<p>The latest cyberoperation was meant as retaliation for the September 14 drone and missile attack on a Saudi Arabian oil facility which the US and its allies blamed on Tehran. Yemen&rsquo;s Houthi rebels, who have been fighting against a Saudi-led military incursion into their country since 2015, claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
<p>The escalation of tensions between the US and Iran started last year when President Donald Trump broke an international agreement signed by his predecessor and launched a <em>&ldquo;maximum pressure&rdquo;</em> campaign against Iran. Trump re-imposed economic sanctions which had been lifted in exchange for Iran&rsquo;s agreement to restrict its nuclear industry, and targeted Iranian oil exports, threatening buyers of Iranian crude with secondary sanctions.</p>
<p>Washington&rsquo;s public response to the September 14 airstrikes was to deploy additional troops and weapons to the region &ndash; the latest in a series of similar moves this year.</p>

<p>India and Pakistan share the waters of six rivers that flow through both nations under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, which has remained unbroken even through three wars. Under the treaty, India controls the waters of the Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers, while Pakistan controls the Indus, Chenab, and Jhelum rivers. However, an estimated 5 percent of India's unutilized water share flows to downstream Pakistani territory.</p>
<p>In the meantime, many of India&rsquo;s largest cities are running out of water, thanks to years of below-average rainfall from a weakening monsoon season. At least 21 cities, including the capital of New Delhi, may run out of groundwater as early as 2020, leaving some 100 million people in dire straits.</p>
<p>Modi&rsquo;s speech was not the first time his government has threatened to divert leftover water from its rivers. Then-Union Water Minister Nitin Gadkari warned Pakistan in February that it would &ldquo;<em>divert water from Eastern rivers and supply it to our people in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab</em>&rdquo; after a suicide bomb attack that killed 40 Indian soldiers in Pulwama. His counterpart in Islamabad accused New Delhi of &ldquo;<em>warmongering</em>&rdquo; and boasted of the strength of Pakistan&rsquo;s army capable of dealing with any threat.</p>

                            <p><strong>Twitter has put US President Donald Trump – and other world leaders – on notice with a clarification of its rules, letting one of the platform’s most popular users know that it can cut off his ability to go viral at any time.</strong></p>
                            <p>Twitter clarified its rules concerning powerful political leaders in a blog <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2019/worldleaders2019.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on Tuesday, never mentioning Trump by name but clearly keeping him in mind. The new guidelines seem uncontroversial enough on the surface, but leave a wide loophole for potential deplatforming of the #Resistance&rsquo;s favorite punching bag.</p>
<p>While &ldquo;<em>direct interactions with fellow public figures, comments on political issues of the day, or foreign policy saber-rattling on economic or military issues are generally not in violation of the Twitter Rules</em>&rdquo; at the moment, they can get a belligerent world leader&rsquo;s tweets placed in a no-man&rsquo;s-land where they cannot be replied to, liked, or shared, Twitter warned.</p>

<p>They haven&rsquo;t had to use the quarantine option yet, but they&rsquo;re just reminding any tweet-happy world leader who might happen to be reading that it&rsquo;s possible, and that it could stop their tweet from going viral. Not that they have any particular leader in mind, or anything.</p>
<p>There are some &ldquo;<em>red lines</em>&rdquo; which world leaders cannot cross, including &ldquo;<em>promotion of terrorism</em>,&rdquo; doxxing, child sexual exploitation, promoting self-harm, and &ndash; in perhaps the most obvious dig at Trump &ndash; &ldquo;<em>clear and direct threats of violence against an individual.</em>&rdquo; Context is key to the latter, Twitter explained, claiming &ldquo;<em>commentary on political and foreign policy issues would likely not result in enforcement</em>&rdquo; &ndash; but &ldquo;<em>likely</em>&rdquo; leaves the door open to the president being deplatformed for his usual belligerent posturing, should Twitter decide his latest tweetstorm doesn&rsquo;t qualify as political commentary.</p>

<p>Harris had called for the suspension of Trump&rsquo;s account after the president accused an anonymous CIA whistleblower of spying and House intel committee chief Adam Schiff of &ldquo;<em>fraud and treason</em>,&rdquo; claiming the tweets constituted threats because Trump had &ndash; offline &ndash; commented that the US &ldquo;<em>used to handle [spies and treason] a little differently than we do now</em>.&rdquo; Those tweets - plus Trump&rsquo;s quote of a Fox News claim that removing him from office would cause a &ldquo;<em>civil war-like fracture</em>&rdquo; - had &ldquo;<em>put our democracy in danger</em>,&rdquo; Harris complained.</p>
<p>Twitter politely demurred to kick one of its most popular users off its platform then, disappointing the president&rsquo;s many haters. But the new rules leave the door open for a more robust complaint to exile the president from his favorite platform, and Twitter apparently wants to make sure Trump knows it.</p>

                            <p><strong>India would like to comply with US sanctions, but the strength of its economy and its strategic interests must come first, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stated, explaining that a true partner would want India to be strong.</strong></p>
                            <p>&ldquo;<em>In specific issues which are critical for India's strategic interests, we have explained to the United States that India is a strategic partner for the United States of America and you want a strategic partner to be strong and not weakened</em>,&rdquo; Sithamaran told Reuters on Tuesday.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>We value the strong partnership with the USA, but we should equally be allowed to have a strong economy</em>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indian oil refiner Reliance Industries is set to resume buying Venezuelan oil after a four-month hiatus, despite the tightest-ever US sanctions on Venezuela&rsquo;s oil industry, citing a paucity of other suppliers of heavy oil. The US-China trade war has taken a toll on India&rsquo;s economy, leading the International Monetary Fund to lower its outlook for the country&rsquo;s growth in 2019, highlighting slow domestic demand.</p>

<p>The country&rsquo;s GDP growth is at its most sluggish since 2013, and Sithamaran told Reuters she &ldquo;<em>ha[d] not closed the door</em>&rdquo; on further fiscal stimulus after passing an infrastructure package and a $11.1 billion loan program.</p>
<p>However, removing the special status of the contested Jammu and Kashmir region and integrating it with the rest of India will improve the economic outlook of both the province and the entire country, she said. Sithamaran dismissed the concerns of human rights groups complaining about conditions in the region, pointing out that they had been silent for decades despite the poor treatment of women, certain castes, and nomadic tribes in the area.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Indian PM Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Chennai to discuss strategic cooperation, with Modi declaring it &ldquo;<em>the start of a new era in India-China relations</em>.&rdquo; The US and China reached a tentative &ldquo;<em>phase one</em>&rdquo; trade deal last week, potentially signaling the end of the 18-month trade war that has decimated global growth for 2019, though the deal has yet to be put to paper.</p>

                            <p><strong>WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange has been subjected to “psychological torture” and his due process rights have been “systematically violated” by all the states involved, according to UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Nils Melzer.</strong></p>
                            <p>Two medical experts accompanied Melzer when he visited Assange at Belmarsh prison in the UK, he said on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>We came to the conclusion that he had been exposed to psychological torture for a prolonged period of time. That's a medical assessment.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Melzer&rsquo;s message fell largely on deaf ears, as only a handful of reporters attended Tuesday&rsquo;s press conference at the UN headquarters in New York.&nbsp;</p>

        frameborder="0"></iframe>




<p>It was not the first time that Melzer has tried to bring attention to Assange&rsquo;s plight. He wrote an opinion piece about it in June, only to find it ignored or rejected by mainstream media outlets, and ended up publishing open letters to the US, British, Ecuadorian, and Swedish governments in July.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;We asked for all the involved states to investigate this case and to alleviate the pressure that has been done on him, and especially to respect his due process rights, which in my view have been systematically violated in all these jurisdictions,&rdquo;</em> Melzer said on Tuesday. No country has agreed to do so, he added, even though this was their obligation under the Convention on Torture.</p>
<p>British police dragged Assange out of the Ecuadorian embassy on April 11, after the government of President Lenin Moreno revoked his asylum, granted in 2012. The WikiLeaks publisher spent almost seven years inside the embassy in London, where he sought refuge from arrest and extradition to the US on charges related to his 2010 publication of top-secret government documents related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Assange, 48, has been jailed &ndash; and later imprisoned on a 50-week sentence for bail evasion &ndash; at the maximum-security facility used to house terrorists, murderers and other high-profile offenders. He has reportedly spent much of his time there in the prison hospital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though he was due for release on September 22, a judge ruled he would remain locked up pending the hearings on his extradition to the US, scheduled for February 2020. If sent to the US and convicted, he faces up to 175 years behind bars.</p>

                            <p><strong>A family of six has been rescued from the hidden cellar of a Dutch farmhouse after the eldest son escaped and wandered into a local pub to seek help. They had lived in total isolation for nine years, ‘waiting for the end of time.’</strong></p>
                            <p>Police descended upon the isolated farmhouse in Ruinerwold, Netherlands after the son, now 25, escaped on Sunday night and ran to a nearby pub for help. Explaining he had left at night because it was &ldquo;<em>not possible during the day</em>,&rdquo; the man &ndash; dirty, unkempt and confused, according to the pub owner &ndash; said he lived on the farm with his brothers and sisters and that he &ldquo;<em>wanted to end the way they were living</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children and a bedridden man, initially believed to be their father, had lived concealed in the basement of the farmhouse for nine years, waiting for the "<em>end of time</em>," according to Dutch media. One Josef B., 58, a handyman who was previously the only known tenant of the house, was arrested at the scene for refusing to cooperate with the investigation.&nbsp;</p>

        frameborder="0"></iframe>




<p>The siblings lived in the basement of the house, which was only accessible through a hidden staircase behind a cupboard in the living room, and were reportedly unaware there were other people in the world. The house itself was isolated by a canal, accessible by a single bridge, and secured by a locked gate. Neighbors who tried to investigate found that the property was dotted with surveillance cameras.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the eldest sibling, the children had never been to school, and they were not registered by any local authorities. The family was believed to be self-sufficient, with a vegetable plot and livestock to sustain them. Their mother is thought to have died before the family moved to the farmhouse &ndash; &ldquo;<em>a long time ago</em>,&rdquo; according to the mayor &ndash; though some reports suggest she is buried on the property.</p>

<p>The only one seen off the property was Josef B., whom neighbors witnessed driving in and out of the farm daily. He would also watch with binoculars to ward off intruders, neighbors reported.</p>
<p>Police are still investigating how the family lived for so long in isolation and the exact nature of the relationship between Josef B. and the family. The siblings have been removed from the home.</p>

                            <p><strong>Charges against the Turkish Halkbank announced by federal prosecutors has critics of US President Donald Trump hopeful of his impeachment, due to reports he tried to intervene on behalf of one of its convicted executives.</strong></p>
                            <p>Halkbank &ndash; officially Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS &ndash; was charged on Tuesday with six counts of conspiracy, fraud and money laundering in the Southern District of New York, for allegedly helping Iran circumvent US sanctions on oil exports between 2012 and 2016 to the tune of $20 billion. The Turkish government is the bank&rsquo;s majority shareholder, and US Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/turkish-bank-charged-manhattan-federal-court-its-participation-multibillion-dollar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> that its <em>&ldquo;audacious conduct was supported and protected by high-ranking Turkish government officials.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The charges come amid the Turkish invasion of northern Syria, for which Trump has threatened to impose economic and financial penalties on Ankara. However, the president&rsquo;s critics at home hope this might turn into a scandal that helps them bring him down.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: SDNY charges Turkish state-run bank Halkbank in sanctions violations in connection with the record-breaking money-laundering scheme to Iran executed by gold trader Reza Zarrab.<br><br>Zarrab was the client whose release Giuliani pushed for between Trump and Erdogan. <a href="https://t.co/pr4AA2dZyb">pic.twitter.com/pr4AA2dZyb</a></p>&mdash; Adam Klasfeld (@KlasfeldReports) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlasfeldReports/status/1184209719218581506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>Trump&rsquo;s lawyer Rudy Giuliani reportedly represented Reza Zarrab, one of the Halkbank executives who was charged with seven counts in relation to Iranian money-laundering and pleaded guilty in October 2017.</p>
<p>Citing three anonymous sources, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-09/trump-urged-top-aide-to-help-giuliani-client-facing-doj-charges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> reported earlier this month that Trump tried to pressure then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to persuade the DOJ to drop the case against Zarrab, but Tillerson refused. This was supposedly done on behalf of Giuliani, who went on to become Trump&rsquo;s personal attorney in April 2018 and represent him in the &lsquo;Russiagate&rsquo; investigation that eventually turned up empty.&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NYT and Washpost reporting add important new detail in the Reza Zarrab story: that Giuliani pitched Tillerson on a prisoner trade in early 2017. 1/5 <a href="https://t.co/ZQ3ICkGrKs">https://t.co/ZQ3ICkGrKs</a></p>&mdash; Nicholas Wadhams (@nwadhams) <a href="https://twitter.com/nwadhams/status/1183100343770636290?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>The alleged Trump-Giuliani-Zarrab connection has fueled speculation among the prominent #Resistance figures that they might have found something to actually pin on the president this time.</p>

<p>Former Obama White House officials have also chimed in, suggesting that Trump was seeking to help Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, rather than just his friend and future lawyer.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">At the end of the Obama admin, Erdogan pushed us hard on the Zarrab case.

<p>Last month, House Democrats opened what they say is an official impeachment probe, revolving around the claims of an anonymous intelligence community whistleblower that Trump used Giuliani to pressure Ukraine for <em>&ldquo;dirt&rdquo;</em> on Joe Biden, former vice-president and a candidate for the Democrats&rsquo; 2020 presidential nomination. As the inquiry was never authorized by a vote, however, the White House has refused to cooperate with the hearings.</p>
<p>Whatever the fallout of the Halkbank case ends up being in the US, the charges are unlikely to make relations between Washington and Ankara any better. In an <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/468784-erdogan-trump-patriots-s400/">interview</a> with Reuters last month, Erdogan said he hoped the US would not go after the bank, adding that it would be a <em>&ldquo;mistake&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;not a rational behavior.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>President Vladimir Putin has gifted his UAE host, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a gyrfalcon – a bird of prey with an endangered status in Russia, after another falcon caused a minor incident at the Saudi palace.</strong></p>
                            <p>Having to give gifts to multiple people can be quite tricky &ndash; how not to offend one by showing &lsquo;more&rsquo; love to another? The answer is right there &ndash; give them identical presents, or at least that&rsquo;s the approach the Russian leader has stuck to. On Tuesday, Putin arrived in United Arab Emirates, receiving a lavish welcome from the country&rsquo;s Crown Prince &ndash; and the exchange of gifts ensued.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/470973-putin-uae-welcome-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>READ MORE:&nbsp;Just like home: UAE sends Russian road patrol after Putin to make him feel welcome (VIDEOS)</strong></a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Putin received a shiny model of an Emirati palace, which used to be the royal family&rsquo;s residence.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/original/5da6374620302709f53ae10d.jpg"  />

            </figcaption>
            </figure>

<p>Footage then showed&nbsp;the Russian leader giving the gyrfalcon to the crown prince, with the Emirati royal visibly enchanted by the beautiful white bird.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="ru"><p lang="ru" dir="ltr">Владимир Путин подарил наследному принцу Абу-Даби Мухаммеду бен Заиду Аль Нахайяну охотничьего кречета, как и королю Саудовской Аравии.<br>В ответ Путину подарили макет бывшей резиденции президента ОАЭ — дворца Каср Аль-Хосн <a href="https://t.co/Pt5n8kuWPx">pic.twitter.com/Pt5n8kuWPx</a></p>&mdash; RT на русском (@RT_russian) <a href="https://twitter.com/RT_russian/status/1184129545508663303?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">15 октября 2019 г.</a></blockquote>

<p>The bird of prey was of the same breed as the one was given by Putin to the Saudi King Salman. This gyrfalcon, however, appeared to be more well-behaved and remained quite relaxed &ndash; unlike the one filmed at&nbsp;the Monday ceremony,&nbsp;in which the gyrfalcon named Alpha got quite nervous and ultimately soiled the floor of the King&rsquo;s palace, right in front of Putin and Salman.</p>

                            <p><strong>UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov has never been defeated in his MMA career, but he admitted that his battle with the scale has pushed him harder than almost any opponent in his career.</strong></p>
                            <p>Speaking at the Synergy Forum in St. Petersburg, Russia, Nurmagomedov revealed that, even with an increased schedule of personal appearances and obligations since becoming the UFC lightweight champion, he still manages to work regular training sessions into his routine. But he said the biggest problem he&rsquo;s faced is resisting the temptation of food that lies around every corner.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The problem is with nutrition,&rdquo;</em> he explained.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I get offered food everywhere, sometimes there&rsquo;s a whole banquet, it&rsquo;s a little difficult. They offer all sorts of things. Some might find it funny, but for me it&rsquo;s not funny because I&rsquo;m the one who has to drop those 16-17kg. Yes. That&rsquo;s how much.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Nutrition is the most important thing. Now I understand why, because when I was 23 I ate a lot but now I&rsquo;m 31 and I digest food differently because the metabolism slows down. I constantly have to stay at a certain weight. Even when I eat now I think of the weight I have to cut in 5-6 months. Therefore you don&rsquo;t eat enough, psychologically you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>When asked what he ate, and was told gymnasts sometimes say they eat just a blade of grass a day, Nurmagomedov joked about his out-of-camp guilty food pleasures.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Right now I&rsquo;m definitely not eating blades of grass,&rdquo;</em> he smiled.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Right now I eat well everywhere. Meat, a lot of meat. Bread&hellip; I can&rsquo;t do without bread and tea with sugar. I&rsquo;m not a fan of butter. I like sour cream, cottage cheese&hellip; preferably fatty.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Two months before I fight I follow a strict diet. The last time it was my best weight cut because I recovered well, I gained 10kg. When I entered the octagon I weighed 80kg and a day before I was at 70.3kg.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>When asked how on earth it&rsquo;s possible for him to gain almost 10kg in a day, Khabib joked: <em>&ldquo;Sour cream! With high fat content!&rdquo;</em> before revealing another of his guilty pleasures: <em>&ldquo;Condensed milk. I like it on pancakes.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Khabib&rsquo;s light-hearted comments about his diet then turned into a serious tale about how cutting weight has badly affected him in the past.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I almost died once from cutting weight, that happened,&rdquo;</em> he said before laughing it off by saying: <em>&ldquo;I think I had too much sour cream!</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This other time when I had major problems with cutting weight, well more so than cutting weight I had health problems due to my kidneys. I had to be treated, had do a lot of aftercare. It&rsquo;s the nature of the sport. We consciously take on such a big risk and there&rsquo;s a big chance that you can ruin your health.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>But while Khabib admitted he&rsquo;s had some serious battles when cutting weight in the past, he hasn&rsquo;t had so many issues during the fights themselves.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you a notable fact that in my 10-year amateur career and 11 years as a professional, I don&rsquo;t remember a single time I had a bruise,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>

                            <p><strong>Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard is no stranger to mainstream media smears, but even a panel of CNN hosts and analysts audibly gasped when one guest outright accused the Hawaii congresswoman of working for Russia.</strong></p>
                            <p>What started off as a standard panel discussion on Tuesday&rsquo;s upcoming Democratic debate quickly took a dark turn, as CNN political analyst Bakari Sellers accused Gabbard of foreign allegiances. As soon as Gabbard&rsquo;s name was mentioned, Sellers took the opportunity to claim that there <em>&ldquo;is a chance that Tulsi&rsquo;s not just working for the United States of America."</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/Bakari_Sellers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Bakari_Sellers</a>: &quot;There is no question that Tulsi Gabbard is a puppet for the Russian government.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/a5qtVjFu2i">pic.twitter.com/a5qtVjFu2i</a></p>&mdash; chris evans (@notcapnamerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/notcapnamerica/status/1184137347832729606?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>The dramatic accusation prompted uncomfortable shuffling from the rest of the panel, with CNN contributor April Ryan asking <em>&ldquo;ohh, wait a minute, what?&rdquo;</em> Sitting opposite Sellers, commentator Angela Rye jumped in to stress that any accusations of Gabbard working for a foreign power are just <em>&ldquo;an allegation.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Sellers was not content to quit, however, adding that it was<em> &ldquo;not just an allegation&rdquo;</em> &mdash; despite the fact that there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that Gabbard is compromised by any foreign country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then Sellers got into the specifics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>There's no question, there is no question that Tulsi Gabbard, of all the 12 [debate participants], is a puppet for the Russian government.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;How is there no question?&rdquo;</em> host Alisyn Camerota asked, seemingly taken aback by the seriousness of the claim. Sellers instantly cited Gabbard&rsquo;s position on the war in Syria as proof.</p>
<p>Indeed, the unapologetically anti-war candidate has faced similar smears of being an <em>&ldquo;Assad apologist&rdquo;</em> and a<em> &ldquo;Putin puppet&rdquo;</em> multiple times due to her criticisms of US foreign policy in Syria, where she believes Washington should never have backed and funded jihadist rebels fighting President Bashar Assad.</p>

<p>As for Sellers himself, he has endorsed California Senator Kamala Harris for president, so his distaste for Gabbard is not entirely surprising. Gabbard won broad praise for expertly taking Harris to task on her record as a prosecutor during an earlier debate &mdash; so much so that the hashtag #KamalaHarrisDestroyed even trended on Twitter (but that was apparently <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/465579-kamala-harris-destroyed-tulsi/">Russia&rsquo;s fault</a>, too).</p>
<p>While Sellers did face some mild pushback from the CNN panel, none of the participants rushed to wholeheartedly defend Gabbard, either. The analyst did experience the wrath of Twitter, however.</p>
<p>Journalist Max Blumenthal <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxBlumenthal/status/1184103659291979785?s=20">tweeted</a> that Sellers comment was somewhat ironic since he is <em>"an actual puppet for corporate America and AIPAC."</em> Sellers is an activist for the pro-Israel AIPAC lobbying organization, which is accused of waging outsized influence in US domestic politics and foreign policy.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Who’s the puppet? <a href="https://t.co/u13MaxKqr2">https://t.co/u13MaxKqr2</a></p>&mdash; Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxBlumenthal/status/1184104347040473089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>Investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald called Sellers' comments <em>"repugnant, McCarthyite accusations of treason"</em> and noted that the CNN panel moved quickly on and would surely allow him back to repeat the same smears on another occasion.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Again, the rules for Dem Party/MSNBC/CNN discourse are repugnant, defamatory and grotesque: anyone - even war veterans - who criticizes establishment Dems is fair game to be accused of treason, being a Kremlin agent &amp; hating the US.

<p><em>&ldquo;If there were a shred of proof that she is working for the Russian government she would be in a whole world of trouble,&rdquo;</em> another user wrote, noting that Gabbard is a major in the National Guard and a member of congress with top secret security clearance.</p>

<p>The anti-Gabbard smears have been bubbling in mainstream media since before she even announced her candidacy, but they went into overdrive after she entered the race for president.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NBC has <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/450613-nbc-gabbard-new-knowledge-smear/">accused</a> her of being supported by Russian trolls on Twitter, while the New York Times recently published a hit piece in the &lsquo;news&rsquo; section, headlined: <em>&ldquo;What, Exactly, Is Tulsi Gabbard Up To?&rdquo;</em> The piece speculated that Gabbard&rsquo;s anti-interventionist stances might somehow make her a Russian stooge, even citing coverage of her campaign by RT of all news organizations as some kind of proof.</p>
<p>Gabbard also won no friends within the Democratic Party in 2016 after she stepped down as DNC vice chair, endorsed Bernie Sanders and accused the party of bias in favor of Hillary Clinton.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabbard has continued her criticism of her party during this election cycle, too &mdash; so it&rsquo;s no wonder that the mainstream media and Democratic establishment haven&rsquo;t exactly warmed to her candidacy.</p>

                            <p><strong>US fighter jets and gunship helicopters were sent to scare off Turkish-backed militants in northern Syria after they came “very close” to US troops at Ain Issa, the Pentagon said. Washington has also sent a complaint to Ankara.</strong></p>
                            <p>F-15 fighters and AH-64 Apache gunships were used in the <em>&ldquo;show of force&rdquo;</em> on Tuesday, an unnamed US official told reporters, after the militants <em>&ldquo;violated a standing agreement&rdquo;</em> not to threaten US troops. A formal complaint was lodged with the Turkish military through diplomatic channels, the official added.</p>
<p>Though US troops have been withdrawing from Syria for the past week, some Special Forces operators were apparently still in the area of Ain Issa, located on the strategic M-4 highway about halfway between the Syrian-Turkish border and the former Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) <em>&ldquo;capital&rdquo;</em> of Raqqa.</p>

<p>Last week, Turkey launched &lsquo;Operation Peace Spring&rsquo; with the stated purpose of establishing a <em>&ldquo;safe zone&rdquo;</em> inside Syria &ndash; mainly on territory held by Kurdish militias allied with the US, but which Ankara considers terrorist organizations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rather than Turkish regulars, however, the troops used in the operation appear to be jihadist militants, which similarly happened in 2016 during &lsquo;Operation Euphrates Shield&rsquo; that targeted the Kurds around Afrin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the Western press has previously referred to these militants as <em>&ldquo;moderate rebels,&rdquo;</em> a senior US official was quoted on Tuesday calling them <em>&ldquo;thugs and bandits and pirates that should be wiped off the face of the earth.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A senior US official told reporters the following about the proxy force Turkey is relying on as part of its Syria invasion: &quot;They could have used Turkish regular troops,...Instead they decided to use these thugs &amp; bandits &amp; pirates that should be wiped off the face of the earth&quot;</p>&mdash; Ryan Browne (@rabrowne75) <a href="https://twitter.com/rabrowne75/status/1184167208580239362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>Meanwhile, the Kurds have struck an agreement with the Syrian government troops to move to the border and block the militants. Previously, the US blocked any attempts to return the territories liberated from IS by its Kurdish allies to the government in Damascus, as they contained most of Syria&rsquo;s oil and agricultural resources.</p>

                            <p>The conservative gadflies at Veritas, best known for making undercover videos of mainstream media figures saying things they&rsquo;d rather keep private, have released a flurry of videos from inside CNN since Monday with the help of a whistleblower technician who worked for the network. The recordings purport to show CNN as being obsessed with resisting President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Even before the first video dropped, however, Veritas director James O&rsquo;Keefe made a point of showing how the hashtag #ExposeCNN is not being allowed to trend or auto-complete on Twitter, despite being vastly more popular than others suggested in its stead.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Twitter is doing everything they can to stop <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ExposeCNN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ExposeCNN</a> and we haven’t even released the story yet. <br><br>What are you going to do tomorrow when we do <a href="https://twitter.com/jack?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jack</a>? <a href="https://t.co/kDe3HDdX2r">https://t.co/kDe3HDdX2r</a> <a href="https://t.co/pGVdj6sush">pic.twitter.com/pGVdj6sush</a></p>&mdash; James O&#39;Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesOKeefeIII/status/1183424205674700800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>By Tuesday afternoon, more anecdotal evidence began coming in from other Twitter users. One shared a screenshot of a search returning no results.&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Project_Veritas?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Project_Veritas</a> I find this interesting.. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ExposeCNN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ExposeCNN</a> <a href="https://t.co/9AtGA1CgHR">pic.twitter.com/9AtGA1CgHR</a></p>&mdash; Goonie Goo Goo (@rjrivers32) <a href="https://twitter.com/rjrivers32/status/1183896189529415682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>Another screenshot showed Twitter&rsquo;s suggested auto-completions for #Expose, with none of the suggestions being <em>&ldquo;CNN.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ExposeCNN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ExposeCNN</a> Also ... twitter is intentionally hiding this hash tag.

<p>Twitter has not officially commented on the allegations. But the company has admitted in the past to hiding certain hashtags &ndash; such as those accompanying the release of DNC documents in July 2016, and Hillary Clinton campaign manager John Podesta&rsquo;s emails in October that year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Testifying under oath before the Senate Intelligence Committee in November 2017, Twitter&rsquo;s acting general counsel Sean Edgett revealed that the platform worked to stop the #PodestaEmails and #DNCLeaks hashtags from reaching users, using automated detection systems to hide them from searches.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Supreme Court declared on Monday that the jailed&nbsp;politicians were involved in <em>"undeniable"</em> acts of violence during Catalonia&rsquo;s attempt to gain independence from Madrid in 2017. Former Catalan premier Carlos Puigdemont, who led the movement for independence, tweeted from exile in Belgium, calling the verdict an <em>"atrocity."&nbsp;</em>Spain, on its part, renewed its bid to get hands on the politician and issued a new European arrest warrant for Puigdemont himself.</p>

                        <p>Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu held a discussion with his US counterpart Mark Esper on Tuesday, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement. The two officials discussed a number of &ldquo;<em>issues of mutual interest in the context of the situation in Syria,&rdquo;</em> as the ministry put it. No further details of the talks have yet been revealed.</p>
<p>The call comes at the time when the Russian military is reportedly helping coordinate the American troops&rsquo; withdrawal from northeastern Syria and the Syrian troops deployed there.</p>
<p>The situation in Syria has been changing rapidly, following the US decision to pull its troops out from the northeast of the country, and the start of Turkey&rsquo;s operation against Kurdish-led militias that Ankara regards as terrorists. The offensive has apparently forced the Kurdish forces to strike a deal with the Syrian government, and the Syrian Army started pouring into regions it had not controlled for years.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Tensions in eastern Syria are flaring, after Turkey launched its military operation in the country's north-east. As Turks and their proxies advance, Kurds retreat, defending themselves – possibly right into the arms of Damascus.</strong></p>
                            <h2><strong>The state of play</strong></h2>
<p>Turkish forces are targeting two areas, Ras al-Ayn and Tel Abyad. They have inched forward 10-15 km into Syrian territory towards Ras al-Ayn and are up to 30 km inside Syria on the way to Tel Abyad. They have even set up a foothold mid-way. The Turkish army wants to block the strategic M4 highway along the Turkish border, which links Syria's economic capital Aleppo with its administrative center, Al-Hasakah, in the country's north-east.</p>
<p>Turkey has deployed commandos, special ops forces, tanks and artillery. Its forces on the ground, all part of Operation Peace Spring, include 14,000 troops, 120 tanks, 230 armored combat vehicles and 240 artillery pieces.</p>
<p>Ankara's campaign is also supported by the Free Syrian Army (also known as the New Syrian Army), which has been sent into the vanguard of the offensive by Turkey. That would put the total headcount at about 25,000 soldiers and officers. Most importantly, the ground troops are supported by five squadrons of the Turkish air force, with 12-18 sorties every day.</p>

<p>At first glance, Operation Peace Spring appears relatively insignificant for the 700 km Syrian-Turkish border. But the offensive is taking place along two relatively narrow corridors. If Turkey's strategy pays off, the Kurds would have to retreat from other regions in northeastern Syria.</p>
<p>Turkey's military planners will seek to surround the key defensive locations of the Kurds, and push locals to the south and east, towards the Iraqi border. More than 120,000 civilians have been displaced, fleeing Turkish troops and the so called Syrian National Army for the towns of Qamishli and Al-Hasakah.</p>
<p>Up to half a million people to the north of the Euphrates may become displaced in the coming days. Turkish air raids are increasingly targeting civilian facilities, including camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs) and detention centers for former Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIL/ISIS) fighters (including from the US and Europe) and their families.</p>
<h2>Mass IS breakouts imminent?</h2>
<p>Before the Turkish campaign, the Syrian Democratic Forces controlled seven jails for IS fighters and at least eight camps for IDPs with half of them housing extremists' wives and children. According to the UN, these penitentiary and shelter facilities held up to 110,000 people, representing 72 ethnic groups from 36 countries.</p>

<p>There is a grave danger that many of the civilians residing in camps may die of hunger or rampant disease while terrorists could break free.</p>
<p>Under an arrangement with the US, the Kurdish military leadership sent the most combat-ready units to guard prisons and IDP camps. And there weren't too many such units in the Syrian Democratic Forces.</p>
<p>Following the launch of the Turkish campaign and the withdrawal of US troops from the border, a move considered to be 'a stab in the back' by the Kurds, the Syrian Democratic Forces said the units that secured oil fields and the Iraqi border in the south of the Deir al-Zor province, as well as units that used to guard detention centers and IDP camps, will be relocated to the frontline.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that fewer security guards and Turkish air raids have allowed some of the inmates to flee. On October 11, after an air strike damaged the building and the perimeter fence of a prison for former IS fighters near the town of Qamishli, five (some reports say 15) of them made their way out of it with the arms that had belonged to the guards killed in the air attack.</p>
<p>The detention center for former IS fighters in Al-Malikiyah, located in the northeastern part of the Al-Hasakah province, has already seen a mutiny. On October 12, several dozen detainees took hostages, seized transport vehicles, used force to free their families from the nearby camp for displaced persons and ran off.</p>
<p>It's highly likely that foreign nationals who fought for IS in Syria will go back home to Europe.</p>
<h2>The Kurds' options</h2>
<p>As for the Kurdish resistance, it will be crushed in any case, since the Turkish army is superior to the Kurds' in heavy weapons and Ankara dominates the skies. And, frankly, some sources are clearly overestimating the Kurdish forces' combat effectiveness.</p>

<p>The best Kurdish units can probably match Syrian general Suheil al-Hassan's battalions. That is to say, Kurds can win against an adversary of similar strength. Faced with a modern army trained and equipped according to NATO standards with fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery, recon and electronic warfare systems, Kurds stand no chance of winning.</p>
<p>The Turks had notified the Russian military attach&eacute; based in the embassy in Ankara about Operation Peace Spring, whereas the command of Russian forces in Syria hadn't been notified in time. Today, they use comms to talk once or twice daily.</p>
<p>What options do the Kurds have left now? Their only option seems to be for the Syrian Democratic Forces to withdraw from the border and lay down their arms. The most combat-effective units can be restructured and integrated into the regular Syrian army.</p>
<p>The other option is to die fighting. It seems the Syrian Democratic Forces have no more variants. To survive, they have to come under the Syrian government's wing. That's the reality the Kurdish leadership has to accept sooner or later. Today, everything is against the Kurds.</p>
<p>When the counter-terrorism operation aimed at crushing IS kicked off, the Kurds were approached by the Russian command and some top Syrian officials. At first, the Kurds seemed to be making steps towards working together, but soon enough they ended up under US control and all talks about cooperation fizzled out. Basically, back then the US just paid the Kurds handsome sums so that they carry out military operations against IS. By and large, that's what the Kurds were living on.</p>

<p>Besides, an overwhelming majority of the Syrian elites was dead set against cooperating with the Kurds in any form, since they were questioning Syria's territorial integrity, to put it mildly. The situation has changed drastically since then, though, with the Kurds now asking for Syrian forces to be sent to the Kurdish-controlled areas and staying away from the issue of Syrian territorial integrity altogether.</p>
<p>Incidentally, there were attempts to reach an agreement with the Kurds during Turkey's previous military operation, Olive Branch. Syrian government forces wanted to take the hard-fought-for Afrin, but the Kurds started haggling. In the end, Afrin was occupied by Turkish forces, who right away started working on changing the ethnic ratio in that part of Syria.</p>
<h2>The Americans' dishonorable departure</h2>
<p>US forces, having left the Manbij area in a hurry, are leaving no fortified zones in their wake, since all they have in the area are makeshift fortified structures, and all their airfields have dirt runways. If we look at what the US presence has achieved in the region, we would have to conclude that the US hasn't managed to propose a constructive agenda for the Middle East. All their efforts have come to naught.</p>

<p>The US Armed Forces deployed in northeastern Syria included Marines and Special Operations units. In reality, however, the US presence was negligible, with no more than 150-200 troops and officers. Add the rest of the Western coalition members and the total number goes up to about 2,500 people. The order to pull US troops out of the region has been given; plans and general timeframes have been prepared. So far, the one thing that remains unclear is the precise date.</p>
<h2><strong>Turkey's endgame</strong></h2>
<p>What's next? When will the Turks leave northeastern Syria? Thus far, they have maintained their presence in Northern Cyprus, al-Bab, Afrin and Idlib. As for the Syrian regions bordering Turkey and occupied by Turkish troops, the local population is being actively 'turkeyfied': branch campuses of Turkish universities are opened, Turkish banks start operating in Syria, and in schools, children are being taught in Turkish.</p>
<p>It appears that Operation Peace Spring will be completed once the Turkish army reaches the strategic M4 highway. However, it is highly likely that, within months after they do, a concrete wall several meters high will be constructed along this road.</p>

<p>With Turkey's military operation in northeast Syria underway, the general situation in the country has deteriorated significantly. IS sleeper cells have been activated in almost all Syrian provinces, especially in the south.</p>
<p>But northern Syria is just as turbulent. For example, in the Idlib province, the Turks control only a small portion of the forces. Up to 20-30 times a day, terrorists carry out attacks, their shelling aimed at Syria's government forces. Moreover, the Turks withdrew a significant section of troops especially loyal to Ankara from the Idlib de-escalation zone and sent them to northeastern Syria to fight the Kurds. So, it would not be an overstatement to say that, at this moment, the Turks in Idlib have little to no control, at all.</p>
<p>Another curious thing about the whole Idlib situation is that Turkey's ninth observation post in the province is currently in an area controlled by Assad's troops. This happened as a result of military activities, during which terrorist groups in southern Idlib, concentrated mainly around Khan Shaykhun, were defeated and forced to flee back to the central part of the province.</p>
<p>It was from these areas that the terrorists fired at Russia's Khmeimim airbase, using multiple-launch rocket systems. And it was from there that they launched drone strikes, attempting to destroy Russian aircraft located at the airbase.</p>
<p>The terrorists were ultimately eliminated and forced to retreat &ndash; as for the ninth observation post, the Turkish forces stationed there now receive food, fresh water and medicine from the Russians at Khmeimim. A fun fact: when passing by Turkey's observation post, Russian troops receive a message on their mobile phones reading 'Welcome to Turkey.'</p>
<p>Overall, though, Turkey's actions in Syria could be compared, to some extent with that of the proverbial bull in a china shop. As for the ultimate outcome of Operation Peace Spring, it is far too early to say.</p>

<p>The French-Canadian dropped the belt just weeks later due to a stomach ailment precluding him from the cage indefinitely but, once healed, he spoke of his interest in squaring off with Nurmagomedov &ndash; a thought which was well and truly echoed by the undefeated Russian.</p>

<p>St-Pierre's retirement was thought to have come after impassable difficulties in negotiating the terms of the potential 'superfight' but GSP - who remains in a high level of training at the Tristar facility in Montreal - indicated that, if the showdown with Khabib can be resurrected, then he is ready to answer the call.</p>

<p>"<em>If the right fight came along, they know where to find me</em>," St-Pierre told <a href="https://youtu.be/BKbXJHF6b-M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>We tried to make the right fight but it didn't work</em>."</p>
<p>There is little mystery as to what that "right fight" is but, for the sake of clarity, St-Pierre was asked to directly respond to whether or not a fight with Nurmagomedov is possible, and if it still interests him.</p>
<p>"<em>It depends</em>," St-Pierre said, somewhat on the fence.</p>
<p>"<em>If everything is aligned contractually, everything is good, as we speak now, yes I would</em>."</p>

<p>The timeline for any fight between the two could well be a sticking point in any future negotiations. Nurmagomedov is widely expected to fight Tony Ferguson in his next title defense and, with St-Pierre due to celebrate his 39th birthday next year, one feels that the sand may be falling through the hourglass a little too quickly for anything to come to pass.&nbsp;</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>An Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) MEP has written to the European Commission to request a probe into whether Greta Thunberg’s eco movement could represent a “hybrid threat” to Europe and be “financed and steered” by Russia.</strong></p>
                            <p>In the written <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/questions/ecrites/2019/002984/P9_QE(2019)002984_EN.pdf">question</a> to the Commission, J&ouml;rg Meuthen notes that he has been<em> "following with interest"</em> the measures being taken by Europe to <em>"avert hybrid threats."</em> He describes hybrid threats as being designed to <em>&ldquo;influence decision-making, to weaken societies and undermine unity.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>But could we really be looking at yet another of the Kremlin&rsquo;s many feared discord-sowing tentacles wearing the doomsaying teen activist as a sock puppet?</p>
<p>Given that Meuthen&rsquo;s AfD party colleagues have themselves been questionably accused of being beholden to and financed by Russia, there is a strong scent of trolling from the German MEP&rsquo;s request. Indeed, almost any political party or figure who is not hostile to Moscow has been pegged as a Russian stooge at some point in time.</p>

<p>A climate-change skeptic, Meuthen highlights the Thunberg-led 'Fridays for Future' school protest movement, as well as Greenpeace actions and the presence of civilian rescue vessels in the Mediterranean, saying they are all <em>"managed professionally and have significant sources of funding."</em></p>
<p>These campaigns, he says, are having a strong impact on politics <em>"to the detriment of other goals"</em> and will ultimately <em>"contribute to a loss of global competitiveness and the impoverishment of Europe."</em></p>

<p>Therefore, Meuthen asks whether an EU investigation has been conducted &mdash; and if so, he says he would like to learn of its findings. One assumes Meuthen is already well aware that the EU has not investigated Thunberg as a <em>&ldquo;hybrid threat&rdquo;</em> and is simply trying to point out what he sees as hypocrisy on Brussels&rsquo; part.</p>
<p>Additionally, the MEP asks if the Commission is willing to rule out <em>"the possibility that these campaigns are being financed and steered by Russia"</em> before conducting any investigation &mdash; a possible reference to the fact that Russia is regularly pinned as the nefarious culprit behind various political figures and movements in the Western world without any evidence to back up such assertions.</p>
<p>Indeed, Russia has often been accused of waging <em>&ldquo;hybrid warfare&rdquo;</em> against Europe, but it has typically been fringe parties on the right and left accused of Russia ties due to their reluctance to adhere to prescribed anti-Russia narratives.</p>

                        <p>Kosovo has withdrawn its application for Interpol membership as it waits for its new government to be formed. Outgoing PM Ramush Haradinaj has sent a letter to the international law enforcement organization&rsquo;s General Assembly meeting, which opened Tuesday in Santiago, Chile, AP reported.</p>
<p>The letter requests that the application be postponed until next year, Haradinaj&rsquo;s press office said.</p>
<p>Kosovo&rsquo;s application to join Interpol was refused last year, when, in a vote by the existing members, it failed to get the required two-thirds approval. Kosovo&rsquo;s government then imposed a 100 percent tariff on Serbia's imports.</p>
<p>Serbia does not recognize the 2008 declaration of independence of what it considers to be its breakaway province. The tariff is among the issues that have stalled EU-facilitated talks between them.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>An RT Arabic crew peeked inside the US compound in Syria’s Manbij, abandoned by the Americans just a few hours previously. Footage from the scene suggests the US troops were in a hurry, leaving behind hardware and personal items.</strong></p>
                            <p>The troops pulled out of the base, located southwest of the northern city of Manbij, overnight and into Tuesday. The retreat follows the decision by the US President Donald Trump to withdraw American personnel in the face of the Turkish operation against Kurdish-led militias.</p>

<p>Just as the US troops withdrew, the Syrian Arab Army rushed to fill in the void they&rsquo;d left. War correspondents followed, catching a rare insight into the secretive fortified compounds.</p>
<p>The RT Arabic crew was among the first to get into the base, hidden inside thick gabion wall. Footage from the scene shows all its structures had been left in place, including personnel tents and huts.</p>

<p>The troops have, apparently, been leaving in a rush &ndash; furniture, personal belongings and even an unfinished supper can be seen left behind. More sensitive equipment, however, appears to have been dismantled.</p>

<p>No one was left to guard the base except for an apparently abandoned puppy, that was clearly delighted to see people.</p>

<p>Other journalists also took the opportunity to inspect the US military facility. Russian war correspondent Oleg Blokhin posted a few videos from the scene online.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="ru"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Russians have been taking a look at a former US military base in Syria, which the Americans abandoned in haste this weekend. “Yesterday they were here &amp; today we are here,” this man says. “Let’s see how they lived.” <a href="https://t.co/HieyUOtgZf">https://t.co/HieyUOtgZf</a></p>&mdash; Bryan MacDonald (@27khv) <a href="https://twitter.com/27khv/status/1184072038731911168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">15 октября 2019 г.</a></blockquote>

<p>He even played around with an anti-SVBIED (Suicide Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Device) barrier at the base&rsquo;s entrance. The mechanism turned out to be fully operational, as the retreating troops apparently did not have enough time to dismantle or destroy it.</p>

                            <p>Ronaldo's goal from the penalty spot wasn't enough to rescue a point against 10-man Ukraine in Kiev but odds are that the Juventus ace will hold it a little more dear than the other losses he has faced in his career.&nbsp;</p>

]]><![CDATA[
    

<p>His 72nd-minute strike from the penalty spot was the 700th goal of his career, spanning spells with Sporting Lisbon, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus and Portugal's national team.</p>
<p><em>"The records come naturally, I don't look for them, the records look for me,"</em> he told reporters after the goal, which was his 95th for his country.</p>
<p><em>"It's not for anyone to reach this number and I thank everyone, teammates, colleagues, coaches and everyone who helped&nbsp;Cristiano&nbsp;become the player that he is."</em></p>
<p>However,&nbsp;Ronaldo&nbsp;said that the defeat to Ukraine in a Euro 2020 qualifier took some of the shine off the achievement.</p>
<p>"It's a nice moment in my career but there was a bitter taste because we didn't win," he said. "We played well, but we didn't win. We did everything we could and we had plenty of chances."</p>
<p>While it wasn't exactly his finest strike, there have been plenty of memorable ones scattered across his several-hundred-goal career.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among them stands arguably his finest goal, the 2009 strike for Manchester United against Porto in the Champions League knockout stages which earned him the first and only Puskas Award - the award given to the 'most beautiful' goal of the calendar year.&nbsp;</p>

            <iframe width="900" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VpakAQkBiHA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    

<p><em>"Proud to score the 700th goal of my career,"</em> Ronaldo wrote of the achievement on Instagram (via translation).</p>
<p><em>"I would like to share with all those who helped me reach this mark. Today we did not get the result we wanted but together we will qualify for Euro 2020."</em></p>
<p>Remarkably, Ronaldo&nbsp;reached the 700-goal mark in almost exactly 17 years. His first came for Sporting Lisbon against Moreirense on October 7th 2002, one week exactly past the 17th anniversary of his first career strike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And given the fact that he is averaging a goal in every two games with Juventus in his second season in Serie A, it doesn't look like the legendary Portuguese superstar is showing any signs of slowing down.</p>

<p>Good Morning Britain, the program he co-presents with Susanna Reid, ran a poll on Tuesday morning in response to the furor with the question:<em> &ldquo;Should Piers stay or should he go?&rdquo;</em> The final results showed that only 41 percent of viewers wanted Morgan to stay, while 59 percent were desperate for him to be ditched.</p>
<p>Morgan had earlier commented on the live poll, urging people to vote and save his job. <em>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s put the snowflakes firmly back in their box,&rdquo;</em> he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The TV host had previously reacted angrily to the petition, <a href="https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/1183302569705295872?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeting</a> on Sunday that he was a supporter of gay rights but that he does not <em>&ldquo;support the ridiculous notion of 100 genders.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Following the viewers&rsquo; poll, Morgan then went head-to-head with gay journalist Benjamin Butterworth, who had signed the petition, over his <em>&ldquo;100 genders&rdquo;</em> comment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>If you can identify in 100 different ways&hellip; and all this other stuff, then I&rsquo;m entitled to identify as a &lsquo;two spirit penguin.&rsquo;</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Butterworth fired back: <em>&ldquo;Being a penguin isn&rsquo;t a gender, it&rsquo;s not on the gender spectrum. Nor is, to clarify, being a giraffe, squirrel or elephant.&rdquo;</em> He argued that young trans and non-binary people who tuned into Morgan&rsquo;s breakfast show to see their identities being <em>&ldquo;mocked&rdquo;</em> could be damaged.</p>
<p>Morgan&rsquo;s gripe was probably in reference to a recent BBC Teach video, which featured educator Kate Daniels telling pre-teen children: <em>&ldquo;We know that we have got male and female, but there are over 100, if not more, gender identities now.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The separatists in southern Shabwa Province also handed over arms to the Saudi-led coalition, paving the way for Hadi&rsquo;s government to fully control Shabwa and other southern provinces, the officials were quoted as saying.</p>]]>

<p>Firefighters are demonstrating against a number of key concerns, chiefly government policies on resources for their sector, funding problems, and difficult working conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Footage from the protests show riot police and protesters squaring up to one another in some parts of Paris, while water cannons were deployed to push firefighters back and clear streets.</p>

                            <p>Goals from Roman Yaremchuk and Andriy Yarmolenko gave Ukraine the win as they made sure Cristiano Ronaldo's 700th career goal had no bearing on the result, or Ukraine's qualification for the finals.</p>
<p>And, after the match, Zinchenko launched into a series of wild celebrations on live television as he joyously sang and rejoiced at his side's qualification for next year's Euro finals.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Never change, Aleks! 😂<a href="https://t.co/p2PVLCNZPl">pic.twitter.com/p2PVLCNZPl</a></p>&mdash; Manchester City (@ManCity) <a href="https://twitter.com/ManCity/status/1184056620126556160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>The reporter trying to stay professional during Zinchenko's boisterous celebrations is his close friend Vlada Sedan, who has been romantically linked with the Manchester City defender in recent months.</p>
<p>Zinchenko famously planted a kiss on the reporter's cheek after Ukraine's 5-0 win over Serbia back in June.</p>
<p>And the Ukrainian defender urged his fellow compatriots to celebrate with their partners to mark the occasion of Ukraine's qualification, telling Sedan: <em>"Now everyone should make love all night for joy!"</em></p>

                            <p><strong>Equity analysts at Barclays say the immediate future for European aerospace giant Airbus looks “brighter than ever,” thanks to a mature portfolio offering reliable cash flow over the next five years.</strong></p>
                            <p><em>&ldquo;Central to our investment thesis on Airbus is our view that the scale and predictability of its FCF (free cash flow) is superior to Boeing, yet Airbus trades at a much larger than normal discount to Boeing,&rdquo;</em> Barclays aerospace analysts said in a research note seen by CNBC.</p>
<p>The analysts have listed a price target of &euro;155 ($171) per share with an <em>&ldquo;overweight&rdquo;</em> rating. Airbus stock was priced at just over &euro;119 per share on the French CAC-40 Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Boeing&rsquo;s current share price is $372 and has risen nearly 16 percent year-to-date.Airbus&rsquo;s range of jet planes is projected to&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;outgrow&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;Boeing&rsquo;s by 2024.</p>

<p>Analysts explained that by pointing to the US plane maker&rsquo;s grounded 737 MAX and the challenges faced in getting its new 777X into commercial service.</p>
<p>Airbus&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;more mature&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;product range could guarantee smoother income, Barclays said, adding that free cash flow could triple from last year&rsquo;s &euro;3 billion to around &euro;9 billion in 2024.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The cash flow profile at Airbus is now becoming more predictable and robust compared with that of Boeing,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;said the bank.</p>
<p>It has calculated that when the two rival companies are stripped back to their commercial airplane divisions, current share prices imply Airbus is valued at a&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;striking&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;45 percent discount to that of Boeing&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The discount is undeserved and doesn&rsquo;t properly factor in Airbus&rsquo;s share of the single-aisle jet market, said Barclays.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We estimate the present value of the total narrow-body industry at $238 billion, which implies that a 50/50 split is worth 140 euros per share to Airbus &mdash; 20 percent above Airbus&rsquo; current share price.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It added Airbus&rsquo;s popular A321 jets alone should contribute &euro;3.4 billion of free cash flow to the company over the next five years.</p>

                            <p><strong>A seven-story residential building has collapsed in Fortaleza, northern Brazil. The Fire Department has confirmed that one person died and at least one other was injured, as the search for survivors continues.</strong></p>
                            <p>Emergency services are at the scene and ambulances have reportedly been seen taking injured people to hospital. It&rsquo;s not clear what caused the collapse, but around a dozen people are believed to still be inside the ruins and communicating with rescue workers.</p>
<p>According to local <a href="https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/app/noticia/brasil/2019/10/15/interna-brasil,797700/predio-residencial-de-sete-andares-desaba-em-fortaleza-ce.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>, the residential building is in the Dionisio Torres, and fell at around 10.30am local time.</p>
<p>The moment of the building's collapse was caught on CCTV camera. The disturbing footage shows it abruptly folding, within a few seconds, and a thick cloud of dust engulfing the area.</p>

                            <p>Justin Trudeau&rsquo;s Liberal Party is under fire from all sides as his political opponents seize on a series of high-profile racism and corruption scandals to try and edge ahead in the polls and take the house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But not all of his opponents are going all guns blazing, as Korsinska, a member of the right-wing anti-immigration People&rsquo;s Party of Canada (PPC), has adopted a different, more eye-catching approach.</p>

<p>Polish-born former Playboy model Krosinska, 35, emigrated to Canada from Poland when she was young and is now putting it all on the line (or on show) as she runs for office in Humber River &ndash; Black Creek, near Toronto, with a population of approximately 110,000.</p>

<p>Krosinska is no stranger to fierce competition and the joys of victory, having won both the Miss Hawaii and Miss Toronto pageants, after which she appeared on the cover of the prestigious Playboy magazine.</p>

                            <p><strong>China has become one of the world's biggest buyers of gold, adding more than 100 tons of bullion to its coffers this year amid the trade war with the United States.</strong></p>
                            <p>According to Alasdair Macleod of&nbsp;<a href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=http%3A%2F%2FGoldmoney.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goldmoney.com</a>, China already pretty much controls the world&rsquo;s physical gold market. He suggests that much of those holdings are not declared as monetary reserves.</p>
<p>Macleod says if America continues its attack, China could declare the proper level of its reserves which could stand at <em>&ldquo;as much as 20,000 tons.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;If they announce just part of that I think that the dollar would be toast.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Beijing would rather take the financial nuclear option in the trade war, Macleod says, noting that <em>&ldquo;US is backing it into the corner on that.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>China&rsquo;s exports to the US <em>&ldquo;become less and less as Beijing realizes that the only hold that America has really got on her is China&rsquo;s export market in America.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Fans were captured on cameras and pitchside microphones hurling racist abuse at England's black players and making Nazi salutes from the stands during the match, which England won 6-0.</p>
<p>Prime minister Boyko Borissov said Mihaylov, who was one of the stars of Bulgaria's 1994 World Cup semi-final team, should step down from his post following the match, which was twice stopped by the referee as the officials attempted to address the abuse being chanted from the stands.</p>
<p><em>"I urge Borislav&nbsp;Mihaylov&nbsp;to immediately resign as president of the Bulgarian Football Union!"</em> Borissov posted on Facebook as footage of Bulgarian fans racially abusing England players went viral around the world during the match.</p>
<p><em>"It is unacceptable for Bulgaria, which is one of the most tolerant countries in the world, and people of different ethnicities and religions live in peace, to be associated with racism and xenophobia."</em></p>
<p>England forward Raheem Sterling was on the victims of the racist abuse from the stands, and applauded the prime minister's sentiments, tweeting:&nbsp;<em>"A good move credits to you M. Borissov."</em></p>
<p>The country's sports minister Krasen Kralev also stated that the Bulgarian government would suspend its relations with the Bulgarian Football Union, including pulling the plug on any financial ties between the government BFU.</p>

<p>Initially, Borissov's call for Mihaylov's resignation was met with refusal by the BFU, whose spokesman Hristo Zapryanov stated: <em>"Of course he would not resign.</em></p>
<p><em>"The state has no right to demand that and interfere in football.</em></p>
<p><em>"The (Bulgarian) Football Union cannot be held responsible for the hooliganism of a group of people."</em></p>
<p>Zapryanov went on to state that the BFU executive committee would meet on Friday, where Mihaylov would issue a statement.</p>
<p>But it seems matters have escalated quickly since the BFU's statement of defiance, with a subsequent BFU statement confirming Mihaylov's departure.</p>
<p><em>"Today, the president of the Bulgarian Football Union Borislav Mihailov submitted his resignation, which will be presented to the members of the Executive Committee at the meeting on Friday,"</em>&nbsp;the statement read.</p>
<p><em>"His position is a consequence of recent tensions: an environment that is detrimental to Bulgarian football and the Bulgarian Football Union.</em></p>
<p><em>"After many years spent in the post and with his many contacts at a high international level, Mr. Mihaylov expresses his firm readiness to continue to help the development of Bulgarian football in every way possible."</em></p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Russia and China are marking 70 years of diplomatic relations. In honour of the milestone, business, culture and media representatives gathered to discuss potential benefits of cooperation with China’s richest province, Guangdong.</strong></p>
                            <p></p>
<p>More than 200 Russian and Chinese experts from various fields met at the &lsquo;Russia and Guangdong: Building the future together&rsquo; forum in Moscow. Symbolically the event coincided with China&rsquo;s traditional Mid-Autumn Festival. Speakers shared views on the importance of developing regional ties and why Guangdong is proving to be one of the most promising destinations for Russians and other foreigners heading to China for work, study or travel.</p>
<p><strong><em>Land of entrepreneurs&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>The south eastern province of Guangdong is home to more than 100 million people, making it the country&rsquo;s most populous region. Apart from the biggest population, Guangdong also boasts the largest economy with a provincial GDP ($1.44 trillion in 2018) comparable to some countries&rsquo;. Its vibrant mega-cities, such as Shenzhen, Zhuhai and the region&rsquo;s capital, Guangzhou, have long become important international hubs for finance, technology, transportation, trade, and manufacturing.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;China is the land of entrepreneurs, and that&rsquo;s even more visible in Guangdong,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;says Artem Zhdanov, a Russian businessman living in Shenzhen, now known as the world&rsquo;s electronics capital and home to tech giants like Huawei and DJI. For the 29-year-old, there was no question about where to base his business development firm and website about China.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Nowhere in the world are products made as fast as in Shenzhen.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>China&rsquo;s most open region</em></strong></p>
<p>Like Artem, other foreign businessmen choose Guangdong for its&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;international way of doing business&rdquo;.</em>&nbsp;The opportunity to&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;network, meet people from different areas, find like-minded partners and realise almost any idea&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;is what inspired another Russian expat, Ilya Gutov, to choose the province to launch his firm that helps foreign app and games developers enter China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coastal Guangdong, along with the nearby special administrative cities of Hong Kong and Macau, has long been among the most open regions in China. It began when Chinese tea, porcelain, silk and other luxury goods made their way to Europe and beyond along the ancient Silk Road. Now the nine cities of Guandong, Hong Kong and Macau make up the so-called Greater Bay Area (GBA), which is set to develop into a world-class urban cluster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Beijing&rsquo;s master plan, the integrated bay area will spur the country&rsquo;s economy and rival other global bay areas, such as San Francisco, New York and Tokyo. The GBA is also a&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;key component of the Belt and Road Initiative&rdquo;,</em>&nbsp;says Li Ang of the Guangdong University of Foreign Languages and International Trade.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bright pearl on the Chinese land that now shines throughout the world.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Cultivating skilled and competitive workforce</em></strong></p>
<p>Guangdong also aims to become a hub for higher education, with several of its universities ranking among the world&rsquo;s best. For anyone coming to study in the province<em>, &ldquo;there is a unique opportunity to become part of the world&rsquo;s economic centre and live in the fastest growing city in the world&rdquo;,</em>&nbsp;says Pyotr Kalmykov of the Shenzhen MSU-BIT University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opened only two years ago, the joint project between the Lomonosov Moscow State University and the Beijing Institute of Technology is said to give students&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;a competitive advantage&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;in their chosen disciplines, as well as in the Chinese and Russian languages. That&rsquo;s why MSU-BIT graduates&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;will be in high demand and contribute to strengthening the partnership between our countries&rdquo;,</em>&nbsp;adds Kalmykov. His colleague, MSU Professor, Svetlana Kirzhanova, encourages Russian students to join the university in Shenzhen to take part in its language and culture exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Public diplomacy</em></strong></p>
<p>Although Guangdong is &ldquo;<em>further from Russia than any other Chinese province, we will cover this distance&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>says director of radio for the Guangdong Radio and Television (GRT) company, Gao Guoxin. With regular flights from Moscow and other Russian cities to Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Honk Kong, Russians can easily explore the province&rsquo;s rich cultural traditions, food, and architecture. Russian holiday-makers already enjoy a simplified procedure for obtaining a Chinese visa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the forum, speakers also agreed that partnerships between the countries&rsquo; media companies are vital in strengthening ties between Russia and Guangdong.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;[Chinese and Russian] media should actively engage in cultural projects and develop public diplomacy together&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;says head of international projects at the Sputnik news agency, Vasily Pushkov. He is also pinning hopes on a partnership between Sputnik, Guangdong and the GRT company in&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;helping mutual understanding between our people.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Russia-Guangdong forum was held as part of the China Festival in Moscow, dedicated to the upcoming 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China and the formal establishment of Sino-Russian relations. Both governments have declared 2018 and 2019 to be years of cooperation between Russia&rsquo;s regions and China&rsquo;s provinces. The head of Moscow&rsquo;s China Cultural Centre, Gong Jiajia, says she hopes the event will serve as <em>&ldquo;a sincere invitation to Russian entrepreneurs and experts in finance, economy, culture and education, to take part in the development of the Greater Bay Area for mutual prosperity&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p>Businessman, Sergey Zhang Sha, said he was <em>happy that Russians &ldquo;had an opportunity to find out about the potential of Guangdong</em>.&rdquo; The region that is serving as the driver of China&rsquo;s economic growth <em>&ldquo;will certainly play an important role in deepening the alliance</em> [between Moscow and Beijing]&rdquo;, says Gao Guoxin. Bilateral trade exceeded $100 billion last year and Guangdong already accounts for nearly a tenth of it, perhaps that explains why Russian businessmen, students and tourists are paying ever more attention to a region that is increasingly punching above its weight.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>A casual aerobatics flyover, another butchered cover of the Russian anthem and faux Russian road police – the United Arab Emirates have gone royally over-the-top to make Russian President Vladimir Putin feel comfortable.</strong></p>
                            <p>After his <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/470914-russia-saudi-cooperation-agreements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first visit to Saudi Arabia in over a decade</a>, Putin proceeded to the UAE. Not to be outdone by their larger neighbor, the Emiratis prepared a few welcoming gestures &ndash; some of which ended up just a bit off-kilter.</p>
<p>After being personally greeted in Abu Dhabi by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Putin went to the Qasr Al Watan royal palace by motorcade &ndash; escorted by several cars that might seem painfully familiar to every ordinary Russian driver. The white Mercedes&rsquo; Emirati licence plates contrasted with the large blue letters ДПС on their hoods &ndash; copying the color scheme of the Russian road police patrols.</p>

    ></iframe>


<p>The &lsquo;patrol&rsquo; was then replaced by horsemen carrying Russian and Emirati flags, an impressive sight, though perhaps not as impressive as the Mongolian president&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/467873-putin-mongolia-genghis-khan-horsemen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genghis Khan cavalry</a>. But the spectacle was complemented by a seemingly casual aerobatics squad flyover &ndash; trailing smoke in the colors of the Russian flag.</p>

    ></iframe>


<p>Finally, upon his arrival at the palace, Putin was treated to a local rendition of the Russian anthem &ndash; which could only be called pleasant when compared to the Saudis&rsquo; bungled performance the day before, but that&rsquo;s not setting the bar very high. Although, judging by his expression, the Russian president wasn&rsquo;t expecting much anyway.</p>

<p>However, the five time Ballon d'Or winning forward will take a modicum of solace from the performance which saw him break new ground in his career goals tally.</p>
<p>Of the 700 goals that Ronaldo has now scored in his career for both club and country, they have come from just 973 games in which he has scored at least one goal on 458 occasions.</p>
<p>The goal, his 95th for Portugal, brings him closer to the all-time top international goalscorer Ali Daei whose 109 career goals sits him atop the standings.</p>
<p>It also places Ronaldo in rarified territory as one of just a handful of players to have recorded 700 strikes in their careers, including Pele, Romario, Ferenc Puskas and Gerd Muller.</p>

<p>Ronaldo still has a long way to go to surpass&nbsp;Josef Bican, who scored a remarkable 805 goals between 1931 and 1955.&nbsp;His chief rival in the modern game, Lionel Messi, currently stands at 672 goals for Barcelona and Argentina combined.</p>
<p>Of Ronaldo's goals, 450 of them were scored for Real Madrid while 118 of them were scored wearing Manchester United's colors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Spare a thought for Sevilla, who are the team Ronaldo has scored the most goals against (27). He has scored five international goals apiece against Sweden, Armenia, Latvia and Andorra.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The record extends Ronaldo's impressive career ledger which also shows records for the most Champions League goals scored, the most goals in a Champions League season and the most caps for Portugal, among others.</p>]]>

<p><em>&ldquo;The humanitarian plight of the displaced in areas targeted by the aggression has worsened with all humanitarian aid being cut and all international organizations ceasing their activities,&rdquo;</em> the statement said.</p>
<p>International non-governmental organization Mercy Corps said on Monday it was suspending its operations in the area and evacuating international staff. The UN humanitarian agency OCHA said <em>&ldquo;more NGO staff had to withdraw and suspend operations.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The World Food Program&nbsp;(WFP) said its operations were ongoing. The UN refugee agency UNHCR said it had assisted more than 30,000 people since the start of the escalation.</p>]]>

<p>UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, addressing lawmakers in the House of Commons on Tuesday, revealed that the government would cease issuing arms export licences to Turkey &ndash;a fellow NATO member&ndash; while they <em>&ldquo;conduct a review.&rdquo;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>No further export licences to Turkey for items that might be used in military operations in Syria will be granted while we conduct that review.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A similar ban on arms exports to Turkey was introduced days earlier by Germany and France. The Spanish government on Tuesday said it would not approve sales to Turkey if it believes the weapons could be used in the anti-Kurdish operation in Syria. Italy said it will not sell arms to Turkey either.</p>
<p>Erdogan has pledged to continue with his military operations, despite international condemnation.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday morning, Turkish forces had <em>&ldquo;liberated around a one thousand square-kilometer area from occupation of the separatist terror group,&rdquo;</em> Erdogan told a Turkic Council meeting in Azerbaijan&rsquo;s capital, Baku.</p>
<p>The president was referring to Kurdish militias, which Ankara perceives as an extension of the PKK, a militant and political organization based in Turkey.</p>

Trump said the move was needed to <em>&ldquo;end the endless war.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>In spring 1945 Soviet soldiers left hundreds of inscriptions all over the walls of the Reichstag in Berlin. These were words of victorious happiness as well as bitter loss.</strong></p>
                            <p>Nearly 75 years after the end of the Great Patriotic War, RT released a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; font based on those inscriptions. Called 'May', it's now available for free download on #VictoryPages project&rsquo;s webpage.</p>

<p>Nearly 75 years after the end of the Great Patriotic War, RT released a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; font based on those inscriptions. Now it&rsquo;s available for free download on <a href="https://pobeda.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#VictoryPages project&rsquo;s webpage</a>. Behind each font character there is a real letter, handwritten by soldiers 75 years ago.</p>

            </figure>

<p>These inscriptions are the voices, words and memories of the victors. With its handwritten characters and symbols, calligraphic and rough, neatly styled and expressively sharp, the font May creates a visual link between the past and the present, between the heroes of The Victory and their descendants.</p>
<p><em>"Font of Victory 'May' is a kind of living graphic monument to veterans. But we want to believe that these letters that came to life, will also serve as&nbsp;a reminder of the&nbsp;price of&nbsp;victory. Remembering and knowing through what hell, pain and suffering the world went through in the middle of the twentieth century, we, the young generation, the heirs of that Victory, must do everything so that people will never again know what world war is.&rdquo;</em>- the project&rsquo;s Creative Producer, Kirill Karnovich-Valua explained.</p>

<p>The font was created by <a href="https://contrastfoundry.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contrast Foundry</a>. Each letter has several alternate forms and sits in line somewhat unevenly, creating a handwritten effect similar to the style of inscriptions on walls. A larger font size would display rich texture, similar to something written on a rough surface, while smaller lettering hardly shows any texture at all making it easier to read - this is possible due to a special algorithm that modifies the letters&rsquo; outline.</p>
<p>This font release is a first step for RT&rsquo;s large-scale project dedicated to the upcoming year marking 75 years since the defeat of the Nazi regime. #VictoryPages is a versatile social media documentary project. It offers an opportunity to look at the historical magnitude of May 9, 1945 through personal impressions of our contemporaries. The story of Victory told for the young and by the young, using the language of modern media will unfold in 2020 on five social networks.</p>

                            <p>As of Tuesday morning, Turkish forces have <em>&ldquo;liberated around 1,000 square kilometer area from occupation of the separatist terror group,&rdquo;</em> Erdogan told a Turkic Council meeting in Azerbaijan&rsquo;s capital Baku.</p>
<p>He was referring to Kurdish militias, which Ankara perceives as an extension of the PKK, a militant and political organization based in Turkey. Erdogan said his country plans to clear an area from Manbij all the way east to the Iraqi border. The land will then be used to resettle some three million Syrian refugees, which Turkey currently hosts.</p>

<p>Turkey has been repeatedly complaining that it carries a disproportionate burden of refugees who fled Syria over the course of the eight-year-long armed conflict. Erdogan <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/turkey-is-stepping-up-where-others-fail-to-act-11571093850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reiterated</a> the complains in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on Monday, saying that his nation now has to either get the refugees back to Syria or allow them to move on to Europe similarly to what happened in 2015.</p>
<p>He said it was<em> &ldquo;portrayed as a threat&rdquo;</em> by Western governments, but was in fact <em>&ldquo;mere statement of fact.&rdquo;</em> Erdogan suggested that other nations should support his campaign in Syria rather than criticize Turkey for it.</p>

                            <p><strong>Addressing passengers as ‘ladies and gentlemen’ is discriminatory against those who don’t identify as either, so let’s just call them ‘everybody,’ Air Canada has decided. So no more gentlefolk on board.</strong></p>
                            <p>Employees of the top Canadian airline were instructed to drop the long-time tradition of calling their passengers &ldquo;ladies and gentlemen&rdquo; (or &ldquo;mesdames et messieurs&rdquo; when speaking French). Instead, passengers will be addressed as &ldquo;everybody&rdquo; and &ldquo;tout le monde,&rdquo; local media reported.</p>
<p>The reason, of course, is that some people have more complex attitudes to their gender than the majority of humanity, and presumably feel excluded when they hear the greeting &ldquo;ladies and gentlemen.&rdquo; After all, Air Canada was named the nation&rsquo;s Best Diversity Employers for 2019 and it has to fulfill its reputation as such.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We work hard to make sure all employees feel like valued members of the Air Canada family, while ensuring our customers are comfortable and respected when they choose to travel with us,&rdquo;</em> the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>The move follows an earlier decision to allow passengers to put an &ldquo;X&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;M&rdquo; or &ldquo;F&rdquo; when booking tickets. The new rules were introduced <em>&ldquo;to ensure an inclusive space for everyone, including those who identify with gender X,&rdquo;</em> Air Canada said.</p>

<p>Well, it&rsquo;s always good to make people more comfortable and accepted, although some inclusiveness advocates may find it too mild a move. After all, there are supposedly six genders for people to choose from &ndash; or 58, or over 100, depending who you ask &ndash; and only three possible letters on the form.</p>
<p>Air Canada was definitely sensible in choosing &ldquo;everybody&rdquo; instead of extending the binary list of honorifics, as they may have faced a backlash for not being inclusive enough. Hopefully nobody gets offended with the new, less polite address.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;St. Petersburg in Russia is absolutely ready,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We have seen it last year in the World Cup. It was a great test of how ready you are, and it was perfect. I was here, and we are not worried at all about St. Petersburg.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The state-of-the-art Gazprom Arena, locally known as Krestovsky Stadium, can hold up to 80,000 fans and was the centerpiece of St. Petersburg&rsquo;s successful Euro 2020 bid.</p>
<p>Ceferin said the stadium, and the surrounding infrastructure, made the city a perfect choice to host matches in the upcoming tournament</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;First of all, the federations have to bid with one venue, so they bid it with St. Petersburg,&rdquo;</em> he explained.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We've chosen it lately for the Champions League final because we know it can be a great experience.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;(The Champions League) has to go to different parts of Europe, but at the same time to the places where infrastructure is perfect and there's an interesting experience for the fans.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The UEFA chief also said the arena, along with the other 11 host venues, will be packed with fans throughout the tournament, with huge demand for tickets to the matches.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Three million people will have the chance to be in the stadiums during the Euros,&rdquo;</em> said Ceferin.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Until July we got 19 million requests for tickets, so everything will be sold out, for sure.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

                            <p><strong>In a move that may rattle some Russia-watchers in the US, the Russian Defense Ministry suggested establishing a new holiday, the Russian America Day. The new honorary date may be set in Russia as soon as 2020.</strong></p>
                            <p>Imperial Russia was one of European nations that went to explore and colonize the New World. Geography dictated that its primary interest was in North America&rsquo;s Pacific Coast, with Russian settlements dotting Alaska and going as far as Fort Ross in California and Fort Elizabeth in Hawaii.</p>
<p>The Russian-American Company, which was created in 1799, served as the vehicle for spreading Russian interests in North America, first on behalf of big Siberian merchants and later directed by the imperial military and civilian bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Maintaining colonies overseas however was ultimately deemed too costly and risky. In 1867 Alaska was famously sold out to what is now called the USA, partially to cover a significant budget deficit Russia had at the time. The company&rsquo;s leadership, notably, learned about the deal after the fact, a sign of how its influence had dwindled over the decades. The next year it was disbanded.</p>
<p>Now, the Russian Defense Ministry wants the date when the company was signed into existence by Tsar Paul I, July 19, to become Russian America Day. This symbolic recognition of historic connection &ldquo;will promote the development of Russian-American relations in the sphere of cultural diplomacy and humanitarian cooperation,&rdquo; the ministry said when submitting the proposal for public discussion earlier on Monday.</p>
<p>The initiative is go through a lengthy process of discussion and approval. If all goes according to plan, the new honorary date in Russian calendar would be established by President Vladimir Putin sometime in January 2020.</p>

<p>Coming from the Russian military, it will likely be taken as yet another act of &lsquo;hybrid warfare&rsquo; by DC pundits. But some bridge-building is desperately needed between Moscow and Washington. Earlier this month, a Russian MP, who was travelling to a conference &ndash; ironically, named after Fort Ross &ndash; was questioned by the FBI at a US airport.</p>
<p>It angered the Russian Foreign Ministry which accused US intelligence services of harassing Russian officials, especially since some of her fellow lawmakers couldn&rsquo;t go to the event at all after the US refused to issue visas to them.</p>

                            <p>It was audible during the live TV broadcast of the match, it was heard by the England players on the pitch and it was even captured on camera as a group of racist fans dressed in black were shown making Nazi salutes and making monkey noises at England's players.</p>
<p>Yet it seems Balakov would have us believe that, in a stadium already part-closed due to past instances of racist behavior inside the Vasil Levski stadium, he couldn't hear any racism from the stands.</p>
<p>Perhaps he should be sent for a hearing test.</p>

<p>However, it appears that Balakov is not alone. The current head coach was an integral part of the great Bulgarian side that reached the semi-finals of the 1994 World Cup in the United States, and some of his former teammates appear to have developed a similar case of selective hearing.</p>
<p>Balakov insisted after the match: <em>"I have heard absolutely nothing,"</em>&nbsp;but seemingly had no issue hearing chants from England fans that he described as&nbsp;<em>"unacceptable,"</em> while fellow 1994 teammate Boncho Genchev stated: <em>"It's not serious to say Bulgarian fans are racist."</em></p>
<p>And even though his captain Ivelin Popov was seen remonstrating with a group of fans at halftime, Balakov suggested it was <em>"probably because the fans were unhappy with the way the team was performing."</em></p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Bulgaria's 1994 goalkeeper and Bulgarian Football Union chief Borislav Mihaylov had criticized England players' statement that they would walk off the pitch if they were subjected to abuse during the game, saying England&nbsp;were subjecting the Bulgarian fans to <em>"unjust branding,"</em> and spoke of his <em>"extreme disappointment"</em> at the players' comments.</p>
<p>And another 1994 alum, Bulgarian Football Union vice-president Yordan Letchkov, said post-match: <em>"It's quite disappointing to focus on racism. It's not serious to concentrate on that if there's a qualifier like this and we're playing against a team like England."</em></p>
<p>It all smacks of denial, ignorance and a refusal to accept the seriousness of what anyone with ears and eyes could see and hear on Monday night. And, by doing so, those once-great players in Bulgarian history are in effect enabling the racists to continue the sort of actions we saw and heard on our television screens on Monday night.</p>
<p>Like it or not, there <em>were</em> racists in the stands in Sofia. They were present, they were prominent and they were vocal. Now the punishment should follow, and the statement delivered by UEFA&nbsp;needs to be every bit as prominent.</p>
<p>Of course, it's absolutely essential to make clear that the presence of those people in the stands in no way&nbsp;means that Bulgarian football fans as a whole are racist. It's also important to note that England still has a racism problem of its own, and England striker Raheem Sterling has been a vocal opponent of the abuse that has been dished out in grounds in his own country, as well as overseas.</p>

<p>But this isn't a petty political game of point-scoring between nations. Racism needs to be stamped out, wherever it shows its ugly face. Bulgaria had already been sanctioned for the behavior of an element of its fans. Now all eyes turn to UEFA to see what they will do next.</p>
<p>There would appear to be only two ways to guarantee there is no more racism from the stands in the next few Bulgarian international matches. UEFA has already imposed a partial stadium closure, but clearly that didn't work. The next natural step is full stadium closure, with the next few home games to be played behind closed doors.</p>
<p>Then, after two or three home games played in empty stadiums, let the fans back in with a clear warning: If the racism returns, your country will be thrown out of the next UEFA competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe then the men with selective hearing at the head of the game in Bulgaria might finally start to listen.</p>

<p>However, chants aimed at England players including Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford continued. The referee stopped the game once again in the 43rd minute but was restarted after the official consulted with England coach Gareth Southgate.</p>

<p>The game would reach its conclusion but not without further instances of racist chanting from the crowd inside the Vasil Levski Stadium, which was only partially open after Bulgaria were sanctioned for a similar issue following their qualifiers against Kosovo and Czech Republic in June.</p>
<p>It was reported on Tuesday morning that the Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov called called for the resignation of&nbsp;the president of the Bulgarian Football Union in the wake of the incident.</p>
<p>Bulgaria captain Ivelin Popov took issue with the actions of the home support and was seen vigorosly debating sections of fans near the tunnel after the half-time whistle was blown.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The best way to bounce back. Proud of the team. There’s no place in football for that - disgraceful behaviour.

<p>UEFA's three-step protocol to deal with racist behavior from supporters dictates that the first warning to a crowd is a message from the stadium announcer. After that, the referee has the power to take players from the field for a further announcement to be made threatening cancellation of the game. The third step is to actually call off the fixture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The referee advanced the protocol to the first step but, per reports, the players voiced their opinions on the pitch that they would like to continue the game which ruled out the referee taking the players from the field of play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"<em>I explained to the players that if anything else did happen in the second half we would be coming off</em>," Southgate said following the game.</p>
<p>"<em>We all saw the second half was calmer and that allowed our players to do their talking with the football</em>."</p>
<p>The actions in Bulgaria appear to be the latest symptom of a wave of racist behavior which has affected football in several European countries.</p>
<p>England's Sterling was also on the receiving end of similar chanting in Montenegro, who were punished with a fine and forced to play two games behind closed doors.</p>
<p>However, anti-racism group Kick It Out have called for harsher sanctions to be imposed on football associations who fail to control their supporters.</p>

<p>The incident comes after London&rsquo;s Metropolitan Police Service imposed a revised <em>&ldquo;section 14&rdquo;</em> order on Monday night, stating that <em>&ldquo;any assembly linked to the Extinction Rebellion 'Autumn Uprising'</em> must stop their protests in the capital from 9pm BST.</p>
<p>Police officers soon after moved in on Trafalgar Square, which had been, until Monday evening, the only legitimate protest site, and demanded that the activists remove their tents.</p>
<p>The majority of XR protesters had decamped to a site in Vauxhall, south of the River Thames, and only a small number of tents and other infrastructure remained on the iconic square.</p>

                        <p>Four mayors from Turkey&rsquo;s main pro-Kurdish opposition party were detained on Tuesday as part of a &ldquo;counter-terrorism&rdquo; operation, the HDP party said.</p>
<p>The mayors are from four towns in Turkey&rsquo;s majority-Kurdish southeast&nbsp;&ndash; Hakkari, Yuksekova, Ercis and Nusaybin&nbsp;&ndash; and all members of the Peoples&rsquo; Democratic Party (HDP).</p>
<p>They were detained as part of investigations into alleged ties to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a bloody insurgency against Turkey since 1984.&nbsp;Six other municipal officials were also arrested, according to Anadolu.</p>
<p>Dozens of criminal cases have been opened against people around the country for criticizing Turkey&rsquo;s military operation against Kurdish militants in Syria since it was launched a week ago, AFP reports.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The United States intends to deprive Russia of its right to the Northern Sea Route (NSR) which lies in Arctic waters and within Russia’s Exclusive Economic Zone.</strong></p>
                            <p>That&rsquo;s according to media reports, saying Washington believes that the NSR should be open to the entire world community, and not only to Russia.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The current US political elite has "suddenly" forgotten Article 234 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which guarantees Russia the right to the North Sea (because it is in the inland waters of this country), and which also recognizes Canada's right to passage northwest of this sea route,&rdquo;&rsquo;</em> <a href="http://www.pecat.co.rs/author/zoran-miloevi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> Pecat magazine&rsquo;s journalist Zoran Milosevic.</p>

<p><em></em></p>
<p>He added that <em>&ldquo;Americans began to present this fact as a Russian "claim" to something that does not belong to the country and their strategy as "ensuring free navigation in the disputed areas of the sea.&rdquo;&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>US President Donald Trump said earlier Washington wants to buy the Greenland. According to US Navy spokesman Richard Spencer, <em>"the current task of the US Navy is to increase power in the Arctic to open new strategic military ports in the Bering Sea region and to expand its military presence in Alaska.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>In May, Washington made it clear to Canada that it <em>"should forget about its right to the northwest Arctic corridor."</em> It has also demanded from China to close its Arctic research stations in Norway and Iceland and to stop investing in the NSR infrastructure.</p>
<p>According to Milosevic, <em>&ldquo;the Northern Sea Route is important for the United States as a means of pressure on Russia, since it is not only an international logistics corridor, but also an internal transport artery.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Northern Sea Route, which stretches the entire length of Russia&rsquo;s Arctic and Far East regions, is expected to become a major trade route for goods shipped between Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said the route would become <em>&ldquo;the key to the development of the Russian Arctic regions of the Far East.&rdquo;</em> According to Putin, the goal is to make it a <em>&ldquo;truly global, competitive transport artery&rdquo;</em> and to significantly increase its cargo traffic up to 80 million tons a year. Ships will mainly transport liquefied natural gas (LNG), oil, and coal.</p>
<p>The Arctic route from Southeast Asia to Europe cuts transportation time in half compared to traditional routes through the Suez and Panama canals. In Soviet times, it was used mainly to supply goods to isolated settlements in the Arctic.</p>
<p>In 1991, the Northern Sea Route was open to international shipping, though in official Russian documents it was defined as a <em>&ldquo;historically established national transport communication.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Last year, Putin said that ships under the Russian flag could receive exclusive rights to transport oil and gas along the route &ndash; a measure proposed to boost the shipbuilding industry.</p>

                            <p><strong>The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator has called on London to “turn good intentions into a legal text,” while expressing optimism that a deal can be agreed by the end of the week. Some of his European colleagues aren’t as convinced.</strong></p>
                            <p><em>&ldquo;Even if an agreement has been difficult, more and more difficult, it&rsquo;s still possible this week,&rdquo;</em> Michel Barnier said on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Reaching an agreement is still possible. Obviously, any agreement must work for all. The whole of the UK and the whole of the EU.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Irish state broadcaster RTE has reported that the UK will bring fresh proposals to the table later on Tuesday in a bid to break the deadlock over the intractable Northern Irish backstop issue, which has held up negotiations for months.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">2/ Two well-placed sources have confirmed that UK negotiators will bring forward a new text when they meet European Commission negotiators in Brussels this morning</p>&mdash; Tony Connelly (@tconnellyRTE) <a href="https://twitter.com/tconnellyRTE/status/1183994148950630400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>The news follows a meeting between British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster on Monday night. It remains unclear whether the <em>&ldquo;fresh&rdquo;</em> proposals are just a rewording of the dual customs scheme suggested last week following a meeting between Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such a scheme would see Northern Ireland remain in the UK&rsquo;s customs territory while operating under EU rules and procedures on tariffs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pouring cold water on any rumors that the end may finally be nigh for Brexit talks, however, Germany&rsquo;s EU Minister Michael Roth reiterated his assessment that a no-deal Brexit would be a <em>&ldquo;disaster,&rdquo;</em> while also playing down any optimism about reaching a deal with the UK negotiators in such a short timeframe.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite sure if a deal is close,&rdquo;</em> he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>France&rsquo;s Secretary of State for European Affairs Amelie de Montchalin said that while her government hoped for a possible Brexit deal, she is remaining realistic, emphasizing the need for a balanced deal and even hinting that she is open to another extension of the divorce deal deadline.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Time alone is not a solution. However, if a significant political change takes place in the UK then that could potentially justify a discussion on an extension if we were asked for it,&rdquo;</em> she told reporters in Luxembourg.</p>

                        <p>Pakistan is hoping to avoid being blacklisted by global watchdog Financial Action Task Force when the organization meets in Paris on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a report by the task force&rsquo;s Asia Pacific Group, which monitors Pakistan&rsquo;s progress, said Pakistan had fully implemented only one item from a list of 40 measures that the country should be taking to curb terrorist financing and money laundering.</p>
<p>Iran and North Korea are currently the only two countries on the blacklist. Being blacklisted would be a serious blow for Prime Minister Imran Khan as he tries to boost Pakistan&rsquo;s faltering economy.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has accused neighboring India of lobbying to get his country blacklisted, AP said.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>An Islamist students’ organization has made quite a stir in India with a video clip, in which teenagers speak about their dreams, including one pledging to avenge every Muslim death at the hands of Indian troops.</strong></p>
                            <p>The controversial video was produced by Islamiс Jamiat-e-Talaba Pakistan, a large student organization with the goal of promoting Islam and opposing secularism in the country, ahead of an upcoming event in Karachi. In the clip, several teens outline their aspirations for the future, which range from personal to quite political and belligerent.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We will employ the Indian Army to clean the streets,&rdquo;</em> one student says, while another one threatens the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the paramilitary wing of India&rsquo;s ruling party, and pledges to <em>&ldquo;avenge the death of every single Muslim&rdquo;</em> at their hands.</p>

<p>The event that was promoted by the video was dedicated to Kashmir, and India&rsquo;s move to strip decades-old autonomy from the part of the disputed region it currently controls. Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba seems to have big plans for a future conquest in response to the move, since the slogan of the <a href="https://www.web-6.site/2019/10/controversial-azadi-e-kashmir.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">convention</a>, which was held last Saturday, was <em>&ldquo;When Hind will become Pakistan.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Indians were not thrilled with the promo, according to reactions on social media. Journalist Naila Inayat, whose post of the clip has since gone viral, said the children in it were part of a brainwashed generation.</p>

                            <p>In&egrave;s Madani and Ornella Gilligmann received 30 and 25 years in prison, respectively, on Monday after a French court found them guilty of the September 4, 2016 plot to blow up Notre Dame which prosecutors claimed would have killed at least 60 people if it had been successful.</p>

<p>The pair packed Madani&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s car with seven gas cylinders, doused it with diesel fuel, and attempted to set it on fire with a lit cigarette. Luckily for dozens of people sitting in a nearby bar, the improvised car-bomb did not detonate &ndash; diesel is not particularly flammable &ndash; and they ran away, though it did not take long for police to track them down. Giligmann was arrested two days later trying to flee the country with her family, while Madani was arrested with two other members of the terrorist cell as they carried out a knife attack on a police officer, planned with the help of the group&rsquo;s mentor.</p>
<p>The jihadi women were inspired and loosely guided by Rachid Kassim, an Islamic State (ISIS, formerly ISIL) terrorist who had released a guide for prospective jihadists on how to commit attacks that included the gas cylinder method. Madani and Gilligan joined a Telegram channel operated by Kassim and sent him videos pledging allegiance to ISIS, as well as a video claiming responsibility for the Notre Dame attack before it failed.</p>
<p>While the women admitted their complicity in the plot, each blamed the other for instigating the attack. Giligmann insisted she tried to sabotage the plot by using diesel instead of something more flammable. Madani only escaped a life sentence because of her relative youth, the prosecutor said &ndash; she was just 18 at the time of the attack, having been recruited herself by a prominent ISIS member she met online.</p>

<p>Giligmann was initially lured into the cell by Madani, who posed online as a returned ISIS fighter looking for a bride to commit acts of terror with back in France. The pair exchanged over 4,000 messages on social media before they finally met, at which point Madani pretended to be the phantom fighter&rsquo;s sister. Madani was additionally sentenced to eight years in April for attempting to recruit for ISIS over the internet, using her fighter persona to urge others to commit attacks in France and Belgium or join the caliphate in Syria.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two other members of the cell, Sarah Hervouet and Amel Sakaou, received 20 year sentences for assisting Madani in the attack on the police officer. Another, Samia Chalel, was sentenced to five years for helping to hide Madani. Kassim was sentenced to life in prison in absentia, though he is believed by US authorities to have been killed in a drone strike near Mosul, Iraq in 2017.</p>

                            <p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been meeting with conservative commentators, journalists, and politicians in "<em>small, off-the-record dinners</em>" and "<em>informal talks</em>," Politico revealed on Monday, sending shockwaves through the internet. He reportedly discussed "<em>free expression, unfair treatment of conservatives, fact checking, partnerships, and privacy</em>" with prominent right-wing critics of Facebook, including Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Washington Examiner correspondent Byron York, and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham.</p>

<p>This, the mainstream media and many liberals on social media have declared, is an outrage. The hashtag #DeleteFacebook was trending for most of Monday as Woke Twitter finally realized the fourth-richest man in the US, who infamously <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/well-these-new-zuckerberg-ims-wont-help-facebooks-privacy-problems-2010-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called</a> Facebook users "<em>dumb f***s</em>," was an unworthy trustee of their digital lives. Just kidding &ndash; they were upset that the platform had become yet another tool of white supremacy.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To more accurately reflect its ideology, Facebook should change its name to Fascistbook.<br><br>After baby pics — ppl sharing far right conspiracies, swastikas, confederate flags, MAGA hats, and incels flashing white power &#39;ok&#39; signs are the next most popular posts. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeleteFacebook?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DeleteFacebook</a></p>&mdash; Bill Madden (@maddenifico) <a href="https://twitter.com/maddenifico/status/1183848143047315457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>"<em>The fear is that Zuckerberg is trying to appease the Trump administration by not cracking down on right-wing propaganda</em>," an anonymous "<em>cybersecurity researcher and former government official based in Silicon Valley</em>" told Politico, giving voice to the fears of many in the Democratic Party. Last week, the platform refused 2020 presidential frontrunner Joe Biden's campaign's request to remove a Trump campaign ad accusing Biden of promising Ukraine $1 billion to fire a prosecutor investigating the gas company that had hired his son. While Facebook promised that any "<em>viral hoax</em>" shared by a politician would be "<em>demoted</em>" and displayed alongside a fact-check, it pointed to a recently-revised policy against fact-checking "<em>political speech</em>" as the reason its hands were tied, leaving the Biden campaign &ndash; and the #Resistance &ndash; fuming.</p>
<p>Wounded liberals took to Twitter to voice their displeasure with Zuckerberg's secret meetings, accusing Facebook of "<em>poisoning our democracy</em>" even as they made excuses for why they couldn't delete Instagram or WhatsApp, both of which are owned by Facebook.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, I still use Instagram and WhatsApp, and yes I feel shitty about it because I think Mark Zuckerberg is an amoral piece of shit, but at least Instagram hasn&#39;t specifically poisoned our democracy like Facebook has. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeleteFacebook?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DeleteFacebook</a></p>&mdash; Bridget Todd 💁🏿 (@BridgetMarie) <a href="https://twitter.com/BridgetMarie/status/1183851974028091392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Zuckerberg sitting down with conservatives is an odd straw to have break the camel's back, to be sure. Facebook users sat quietly by when it emerged that the platform had <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/446833-facebook-data-sharing-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a> their private data, including messages sent to other users, with over 150 corporate "<em>partners</em>" without their knowledge or consent. There was no user uprising when the platform was discovered to be <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/459858-facebook-shares-data-phone-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collaborating</a> with phone companies to rate customers' "<em>creditworthiness</em>" based on their profiles. #DeleteFacebook didn't trend when the platform quietly suspended tens of thousands of apps for violating users' privacy and <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/469281-facebook-blocks-thousands-apps-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted</a> it would be unable to catch all of the other perpetrators, or when a Facebook lawyer made the jaw-dropping <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/460790-facebook-lawyer-denies-privacy-exists/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claim</a> that users have no expectation of privacy at all.</p>

<p>Facebook notoriously collaborates with the US government to remove accounts both domestically and abroad, and works with the Israeli government to stifle the free speech of Palestinians, many of whom get their news exclusively through Facebook. A recent EU court ruling paved the way for Facebook to be weaponized by European countries to remove so-called "<em>hate speech</em>" by users halfway around the world. And Facebook has even struggled to play down <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/449795-facebook-friendly-fraud-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complaints</a> that it exploits children by luring them into spending wads of their parents' cash on online games.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of these offenses rankled #Resistance Twitter as much as a friendly (off-the-record) dinner with Tucker Carlson. Users attacked the "<em>hateful, dangerous platform</em>" as "<em>irresponsible</em>" and slammed it for "<em>undermining democracy</em>." But even liberals have admitted, when polled about other <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/470153-americans-social-media-fail-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issues</a>, that Facebook content favors the Democratic Party, and <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/342419-facebook-censored-conservative-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">former</a> <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/452699-whistleblower-exposes-facebook-suppressing-conservatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">employees</a> have admitted to suppressing conservative posts. Wouldn't it be ironic if the company that has abused its users in every way imaginable was finally kicked to the curb for listening to their complaints and trying to change?</p>

This time, though, it was not just about glorification of Ukraine's dubious past, as far-right groups projected their war fantasies onto the nation's troubled present.</p>

<p>The largest rally, under the slogan <em>"Defend the Ukrainian land!"</em> was organized by the All-Ukrainian Union 'Svoboda' (Freedom) &ndash; an ultranationalist party formerly known as the Social-National Party of Ukraine. Members of far-right groups such as the Right Sector and the Organization of the Ukrainian Nationalists also joined the rally. According to the organizers, there were some 10,000 people in attendance.</p>

<p>The protesters marched all the way from Maidan Square to the presidential office, chanting slogans against President Volodymir Zelensky, who recently agreed to the so-called 'Steinmeier Formula' &ndash; a roadmap for Ukraine's breakaway eastern regions to receive autonomy &ndash; in a bid to bring the stalled peace process out of a deadlock. The nationalists branded the Ukrainian leader a <em>"traitor"</em> while denouncing the peace plan as a threat to Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty.</p>

<p>Another far-right party, the National Corps, organized its own march under the slogan <em>"No to capitulation!"</em> and also directed against the peace roadmap. Thousands of marchers were chanting aggressive slogans, some of which clearly resembled those of the Nazi Germany like <em>"Ukraine above all things!"</em> Other chants included <em>"Glory to the Nation!"</em> and <em>"Death to our enemies!"</em> Some of the protesters were also carrying burning flares.</p>

<p>No major incidents occurred during the marches, as some 1,500 officers were providing security in the center of the Ukrainian capital. On the sidelines of the protests, however, unidentified <em>"masked men"</em> brought an effigy of the Ukrainian oligarch Igor Kolomoisky to a Kiev synagogue.</p>

            <center><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Feduard.dolinsky%2Fposts%2F2775998302432220&width=500" width="500" height="469" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></center>
    

<p>One of the country's wealthiest businessmen, Kolomoisky also happens to be the president of the United Jewish Community of Ukraine and was once described as the man behind Zelensky's rise to power. A photo published in Facebook by the head of the Ukrainian Jewish committee, Eduard Dolinsky, shows an effigy with a photo of Kolomoisky dipped in red dye thrown at the synagogue entrance. No one has been detained over the incident yet, according to local media.</p>

                            <p>State news agency SANA broke the news on Monday, confirming the earlier sightings of the Syrian troops in the area, first spotted overnight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The confirmation comes a few hours after Turkey signaled that its military and affiliated Syrian <em>&ldquo;opposition&rdquo;</em> militants have sought to enter the city after the withdrawal of the Kurdish-led militias.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We are about to implement our decision on Manbij,&rdquo;</em> Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters on Monday. <em>&ldquo;When Manbij is evacuated, we will not go in there as Turkey. Our Arab brothers, who are the real owners, the tribes ... will return there. Our approach is to ensure their return and security there.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The map of control in Syria is once again going through rapid changes after Turkey began an invasion of the northeast border areas, dubbed &lsquo;Operation Peace Spring.' The offensive targets Kurdish-led militias that Ankara considers to be terrorists. This includes the so-called Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group, that has been the key US ally in its fight against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) terrorists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Turkey&rsquo;s operation kicked off days after the decision by US President Donald Trump to withdraw American servicemen embedded with the Kurdish forces, in a move that has been condemned by his critics as a <em>&ldquo;betrayal&rdquo;</em> of the Syrian Kurds. Trump said the move was needed to <em>&ldquo;end the endless war.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>As the Turkish-backed operation gained momentum, Trump authorized a withdrawal of US troops from the region so they wouldn't get caught in the crossfire. At the same time, the Syrian Army made a move towards the northern border &ndash; which the US troops blocked it from reaching for years &ndash; in order to support Kurdish-led forces against what it called <em>&ldquo;Turkish aggression.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Syrian Army meet US troops on a highway as American forces move out from Kobani.

<p>It appears that Syrian troops are trying to fill in the vacuum left by the US forces as quickly as they leave. On Monday, RT&rsquo;s video agency Ruptly filmed Syrian units advancing towards the Kurdish-held border town of Kobani &ndash; and meeting US troops on their way out.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><strong>By sentencing nine Catalan politicians to a total 100 years in prison for “sedition” over nonviolent resistance, Madrid has made them martyrs and signed its death warrant, former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond told RT.</strong></p>
                            <p>The Spanish court&rsquo;s sentencing of nine Catalan politicians to between nine and 13 years in prison each for the archaic offense of sedition over their peaceful efforts to achieve independence &ldquo;<em>will be a day of democratic infamy as far as Spain is concerned</em>,&rdquo; Salmond told RT on Monday. Worse &ndash; for Spain, at least &ndash; it is a sign that Spanish control of the province is coming to an end.</p>

    ></iframe>


<p>The sentences were &ldquo;<em>antidemocratic, oppressive and totally counterproductive</em>&rdquo; for the Spanish government, because &ldquo;<em>now [the pro-independence politicians] will achieve martyrdom</em>,&rdquo; Salmond explained.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>This is the day that these Spanish judges actually sealed the fate of the Spanish state. I don&rsquo;t see the Catalan crisis ending now anywhere except in Catalan independence</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Catalans were found guilty of sedition, but not rebellion, the most serious of the charges they faced over the 2017 declaration of independence. The secession attempt followed a referendum, banned by the Madrid government, that saw 90 percent of Catalans vote for independence despite a heavy-handed crackdown on those 42 percent who turned out to polls.</p>

        frameborder="0"></iframe>




<p>The Supreme Court declared all defendants were all involved in &ldquo;<em>undeniable</em>&rdquo; acts of violence during the uprising, while they countered they were on trial for their ideas and not their actions and had merely sought to give Catalan citizens a voice.</p>
<p>Salmond slammed the government&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>oppressive</em>&rdquo; use of the judicial system to &ldquo;<em>silence their political opponents</em>,&rdquo; noting it &ldquo;<em>will have exactly the opposite effect</em>&rdquo; &ndash; and sure enough, the streets of Barcelona were packed with protesters outraged over the verdict.</p>

<p>Slamming Madrid for its archaic definition of &ldquo;<em>sedition</em>&rdquo; as a crime even in the absence of violence, Salmond called for the government to be put on trial over its &ldquo;<em>undemocratic actions</em>&rdquo; and predicted that Catalan politicians would obtain justice in the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg, where they will appeal the verdict.&nbsp;As First Minister, Salmond led the Scottish independence referendum in 2014.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>When elected politicians use unelected judges to sentence other elected politicians to 100 years between the nine of them, then things have reached a point which cannot be sustained, and the Spanish state I don&rsquo;t think will survive this outrage.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Salmond&rsquo;s words echoed those of Catalan Republican Left party leader Oriol Junqueras, who received the longest prison term of the group, 13 years. Upon his sentencing, Junqueras said independence for Catalonia was &ldquo;<em>closer than ever</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carlos Puigdemont, the former Catalan premier who led the 2017 bid for independence, tweeted in solidarity from Belgium, where he fled to avoid arrest after the uprising, calling the verdict an &ldquo;<em>atrocity</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spain has thus far been unsuccessful in convincing other European countries to extradite Puigdemont and his fellow Catalan pro-independence politicians, but that did not stop the Supreme Court from reactivating a European arrest warrant for him following Monday&rsquo;s sentencing.</p>

                            <p><strong>An unlikely road meeting of US and Syrian troops was captured in northern Syria as the American vehicles were retreating from the Kurdish-held town of Kobani, while the Syrians rushed to protect it from the Turkish-led offensive.</strong></p>
                            <p>Getting American and Syrian government forces into a single image is quite a difficult task despite the protracted &ndash; and illegal &ndash; US military presence in the war-torn country. Nonetheless, RT&rsquo;s video agency Ruptly managed to snap a rare shot at a highway between northern Syrian towns of Tabaqqa and Kobani.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The short clip from the scene shows a US military convoy of several armored vehicles leaving the border town of Kobani. A Syrian military unit, transported on apparently less fancy vehicles, is seen heading towards the town.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear if the servicemen somehow reacted to seeing one another, as both parties seemed to be in a rush.</p>
<p>The US military has been withdrawing from northeast Syria following the orders by President Donald Trump, issued last Monday. The withdrawal has been sped up by the Turkish-led military operation against the Kurdish militia, one-time ally of the US, that incidentally heads the so-called Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) controlling around one-third of Syria&rsquo;s territory. Washington used the SDF as a ground force in the fight against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS).</p>

<p>Ankara regards Kurdish militia groups as terrorists over links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers&rsquo; Party (PKK), which has been waging insurgency in Turkey&rsquo;s southeast for decades, ultimately seeking secession from the country. However, the Turkish incursion into Syria, which aims to establish a 30-km wide <em>&ldquo;safe zone&rdquo;</em> and plant previously displaced refugees and Ankara-backed Islamist rebel groups there, was not met with open arms by Damascus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After apparently striking a deal with the Kurds, the Syrian Army said it was moving in to secure the strategic border area and entered the towns of Qamishli and Manbij. Kobani, once famously besieged by ISIS, is likely to become a hotspot of conflict again due to its position right on the Syrian-Turkish border.</p>

                            <p><strong>A Texas police officer who shot and killed a black woman through a window of her own home while she was playing video games with her nephew has been arrested and charged with murder, the Fort Worth interim police chief has said.</strong></p>
                            <p>Aaron Dean was arrested and charged with murder for the killing of Atatiana Jefferson just hours after he resigned from his position at the Fort Worth Police Department. Jefferson, 28, was killed after a neighbor had called a non-emergency police line for a welfare check because they noticed that her front door was open in the middle of the night. Upon arriving, one of the responding officers shouted commands before opening fire through a window after &ldquo;<em>perceiving a threat.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a statement, police said the officer had seen a person standing inside the residence and fired one shot at the &lsquo;suspect&rsquo; before going inside to give the woman emergency medical care. Jefferson died in her bedroom with her eight-year-old nephew in the house.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This incident is all the more reason to know and exchange phone numbers with your neighbors.

<p>At a press conference on Monday, Police Chief Ed Kraus identified the shooter as 35-year-old officer Aaron Dean, who had joined the department in April 2018. Kraus claimed he planned to fire Dean if he had not resigned by Monday morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Had the officer not resigned I would have fired him for violations of several policies, including our use of force policy, our de-escalation policy, and unprofessional conduct,&rdquo;</em> Kraus said, adding that Dean has not cooperated with the investigation.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Former FW police officer Aaron Dean resigned this morning before he could be fired, according to FWPD Interim Chief Ed Kraus.

<p>Body camera footage released by the police department shows the officer approaching the home. He shines a flashlight into what looks like a dark room and shouts <em>&ldquo;Put your hands up! Show me your hands!&rdquo;</em> &ndash; but he does not identify himself as a police officer. Police said they released the footage to provide <em>&ldquo;transparent and relevant information to the public.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price called the shooting unjustifiable and unacceptable. <em>&ldquo;There is nothing that can justify what happened on Saturday morning &ndash; nothing,&rdquo;</em> she told journalists.</p>

<p>The neighbor who called the police, James Smith, told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that he was worried when he saw Jefferson&rsquo;s door open because he knew she was there with her nephew. Smith told the newspaper that he felt partly responsible for her death. <em>&ldquo;If I had never dialed the police department, she&rsquo;d still be alive,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>Kraus told reporters an investigation into the shooting is ongoing and an update will be released on Tuesday. He added that the FBI had also been briefed and will investigate possible civil rights violations.</p>

<p>Lee Merritt, an attorney for the families of both Jefferson and Jean, told CNN that she had been playing video games with her young nephew before she died. <em>&ldquo;There was no reason for her to be murdered,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>I will be visiting NATO next week in Brussels, where I plan to press our other NATO allies to take collective and individual diplomatic and economic measures in response to these egregious Turkish actions.</em></strong></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;President Erdogan bears full responsibility&rdquo;</em> for <em>&ldquo;a potential ISIS resurgence, possible war crimes, and a growing humanitarian crisis,&rdquo;</em> Esper warned, pinning the responsibility for <em>&ldquo;widespread casualties, refugees, destruction, insecurity, and a growing threat to US military forces&rdquo;</em> exclusively on Turkey.</p>

<p>While Turkey had given the US and regional powers weeks of advance notice of its plans to create a so-called <em>&ldquo;safe zone&rdquo;</em> in northeast Syria before launching 'Operation Peace Spring' last week, the US has framed the campaign as a reckless and irresponsible operation, threatening Ankara with hefty sanctions and announcing a 50 percent increase on steel tariffs.</p>

<p>After withdrawing a small contingent of US forces from the Syrian-Turkish border last week, President Donald Trump threatened to <em>&ldquo;destroy&rdquo;</em> Turkey&rsquo;s economy if the country stepped out of line, without explaining exactly what actions on Ankara&rsquo;s part would trigger that destruction.</p>

<p>As a member of NATO, Turkey is supposed to be protected from unilateral sanctions and other seemingly arbitrary punishments. However, Germany and France have already halted weapons sales to the country, and it&rsquo;s unlikely other members of the alliance will defy Washington's&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;pressure.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged on Friday that he would not <em>&ldquo;stop this fight, no matter what anyone says,&rdquo;</em> emphasizing that Turkey&rsquo;s quarrel is not with the Kurds as a people, but with <em>&ldquo;terrorist&rdquo;</em> militias.</p>

Kurdish militias working with the US against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) are considered by Ankara to be terrorist organizations, and the operation was aimed at pushing them back 30 km away from the border.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Let Syria and Assad protect the Kurds and fight Turkey for their own land,&rdquo;</em> Trump had tweeted an hour earlier, referring to the Syrian president Bashar Assad, and adding he would much rather focus on defending the US border with Mexico.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">....I would much rather focus on our Southern Border which abuts and is part of the United States of America.

<p>This may already be happening, as the Syrian Arab Army has been spotted moving towards the border on Monday under an apparent deal with the Kurds. The US has previously blocked any attempts by the Syrian government to reclaim territory liberated from IS by the Kurdish militias, seeking to establish some kind of parallel administration in hopes of eventually overthrowing Assad.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Poland&rsquo;s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party secured a narrow majority in the lower house of parliament in Sunday&rsquo;s general election, according to the final result count announced by the Electoral Commission on Monday.</p>
<p>The Commission said the socially conservative but economically left-leaning PiS secured 235 seats in the 460-seat legislature.</p>
<p>However, PiS expects delays to its legislative agenda after the party lost its majority in the upper house of parliament, the Senate.</p>
<p>Throughout the campaign, PiS told voters that business and cultural elites should be replaced with people who espouse patriotic values, Reuters reports. The main opposition grouping in the country is the centrist Civic Coalition.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>President Vladimir Putin has been greeted in Saudi Arabia by a dodgy rendition of the Russian national anthem. The performance was far from stellar – but still merely mediocre, compared to some of the worst-ever anthem fails.</strong></p>
                            <p>The unexpected ear-shattering performance of the country&rsquo;s anthem awaited Russia&rsquo;s president at the Saudi royal palace as he met King Salman on Monday. An entire military orchestra, accompanied by a sizeable honor guard detachment, performed for the two leaders right inside the palace &ndash; and their rendition of the Russian anthem turned out to be a bit off &ndash; to put it mildly.</p>

It seems the Saudi royal orchestra has learned something from the utterly shameful version of the US national anthem it performed back in 2017 to greet US President Donald Trump.</p>

<p><a href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DxOLXGk0Ojlg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>That performance of the US anthem was arguably on a par with the notoriously disastrous renditions of national anthems repeatedly produced by an Egyptian military orchestra. Back in 2015, they slaughtered the Russian anthem, &lsquo;spicing up&rsquo; Putin&rsquo;s visit.</p>

                            <p><strong>Barcelona’s El Prat airport has seen some brutal fighting as police in riot gear faced off with huge crowds of Catalans, angered by the lengthy prison sentences handed to the organizers of the 2017 independence referendum.</strong></p>
                            <p>The Spanish Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision on Monday to sentence the Catalan officials behind the referendum to between nine and 13 years has sparked a storm of protests in the capital of the wealthy autonomous Spanish province. The court also issued a European arrest warrant for former regional president Carles Puigdemont.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crowds of people poured into the streets of Barcelona within mere minutes of the ruling. Soon, Democratic Tsunami, a local group in favor of a more active form of civil disobedience, called on tens of thousands of its members to march on the city airport, located 15 kilometers away from the center of Barcelona.</p>

        frameborder="0"></iframe>




<p>The airport then saw fierce fighting between the crowds of angry protesters who had heeded the call, and the riot police deployed to the scene. Videos from the airport showed officers in full riot gear brutally dispersing the crowds by beating people with batons and pushing them to the ground.</p>

<p>Yet, about 8,000 demonstrators managed to get inside, effectively stalling operations at the airport.

<p>The clashes at the airport follow mass protests in the Catalan capital itself, which saw some Barcelona streets blocked by demonstrators.&nbsp;Scuffles have also been reported in several big Catalan municipalities, such as Girona and Lleida.</p>

<p>Tensions between the Catalans and the Spanish central government have hardly subsided over the two years since the ill-fated independence vote, which Madrid declared illegal and invalid, as about a half of the seven-million-strong provincial population still support independence.</p>

<p>The court ruling that sentenced nine out of 12 separatist leaders to lengthy prison terms is likely to reignite those simmering tensions that have already been manifested in large-scale demonstrations and clashes between the protesters and police in the wake of the contentious vote.</p>

<p>The public anger over the sentences is shared by the province&rsquo;s leadership. Catalonia&rsquo;s President Quim Torra condemned it as <em>&ldquo;an act of vengeance, not an act of justice.&rdquo;</em> Puigdemont, the former regional president and the face of the separatist movement, who remains in exile in Belgium, denounced the 100 years of total prison time for his former associates as an <em>&ldquo;atrocity.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p>Cecchetti landed the technique in the first round of the fight in Milan. And, despite his eye bleeding profusely and swelling up almost immediately, the Italian bravely battled on after somehow convincing ringside medics that he was fit to continue.</p>

<p>However, it wouldn't last. The injury continued to worsen as the first round extended and it eventually became too much for even&nbsp;Avogadro as he was forced to concede the bout via injury TKO.</p>

<p>The technique, known as a 'switch knee', involves faking that you are going to attack with one knee before using it as momentum to thrust your other knee towards your opponent at full force.</p>
<p>It is regularly seen in mixed martial arts, perhaps most notably in July when Jorge Masvidal used the same skill to defeat Ben Askren just five seconds into their fight at UFC 239.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><strong>Boris Johnson was left embarrassed after a lawmaker he had fired from the Tory Party over Brexit issues suggested it was rather hypocritical of him to condemn Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour for “Soviet-era expulsions.”</strong></p>
                            <p>During the debate on the Queen&rsquo;s speech, which laid out the UK government&rsquo;s policy agenda for the next parliamentary session, Johnson laid into the opposition over their handling of internal staffing issues.</p>
<p>In his typically blustering, idiosyncratic style, Johnson made a joke about Corbyn&rsquo;s chief of staff Karie Murphy and his political director Amy Jackson being moved to Labour HQ in preparation for the party&rsquo;s general election campaign.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I fear for his political health, because we can all see the Soviet-era expulsions that are taking place in his circle, as one by one his lieutenants are purged.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em></em>However, the smear didn&rsquo;t go unnoticed by Antoinette Sandbach, the now-Independent MP for Eddisbury, who was expelled from the Conservative Party for supporting a Brexit law that compels Johnson to ask Brussels for an extension if he fails to secure a deal by October 31.</p>
<p>During an intervention in the House of Commons, Sandbach gleefully told the prime minister: <em>&ldquo;I welcome the prime minister&rsquo;s opportunity to revisit the marxist-style expulsions from the Conservative Party,&rdquo;</em> before moving on to a domestic issue about trains.</p>
<p>Johnson sheepishly rose to his feet and declined to address the former Tory MP&rsquo;s specific point on expulsions, preferring to stick to her follow-up question.</p>
<p>Despite consistent accusations of threats of purges within the Labour Party, to date no MP in Corbyn&rsquo;s party has been forced out by the leadership. In contrast, Johnson removed the party whip from 21 of his fellow Conservatives in September.</p>

                            <p><strong>A man who lived for eight years as a trans woman before de-transitioning has called out the “child abuse” from adults who encourage transgenderism in kids, saying it’s an “abhorrent” interference in their natural development.</strong></p>
                            <p>Born male, Walt Heyer began transitioning to female at 42 years-old. He lived that way for eight years before realizing he had been a victim of childhood abuse and began the process of returning to his birth-assigned gender.</p>
<p>In an explosive interview with controversial conservative host Candace Owens, Heyer re-told the story of his troubled childhood; how his grandmother sparked gender confusion by encouraging him to wear a purple dress at the age of four &ndash; and how he suffered sexual abuse at the hands of an uncle as a direct result.&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The MOST IMPORTANT interview I’ve ever done is out now! <br><br>Former Transgender woman Walt Heyer completely obliterates the “trans” narrative &amp; reveals the truth; children switching genders signifies child abuse from the adults that watch them.<br><br>Watch HERE: <a href="https://t.co/MMMS1LNy4m">https://t.co/MMMS1LNy4m</a> <a href="https://t.co/vmhmw6AQJi">pic.twitter.com/vmhmw6AQJi</a></p>&mdash; Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) <a href="https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1183395942088794112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p><em>&ldquo;The consequences of [grandma] affirming me became very destructive &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s actually evil and it&rsquo;s child abuse to indicate that you can change genders at such a young age, and I&rsquo;m speaking from 74 years of experience, so it&rsquo;s not like I just came to this conclusion,&rdquo;</em> Heyer told Owens.</p>
<p>Today they call it gender dysphoria, but <em>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s really just child abuse,&rdquo;</em> he said.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>It confused my identity of who I was &ndash; the seed was planted and the destruction had started.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heyer believes that the idea of gender dysphoria is introduced to children by adults and that a person is<em> &ldquo;not born with it.&rdquo;</em> To encourage it creates an abhorrent<em> &ldquo;early sexualization&rdquo;</em> of the child, he said.</p>
<p>Heyer now runs a website for those who regret transitioning and publishes books and articles on the subject. He believes there is a misconception that transgenderism has something to do with being gay, but claims that 95 percent of the people who he speaks to about wanting to detransition are not gay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, he adds, a desire to transition is usually a <em>&ldquo;bandaid&rdquo;</em> for something else &ndash; often abuse &ndash; which makes the person not want to be who they are.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a way to escape, and this is where the dissociation comes in. You don&rsquo;t want to be who you are, so you attempt to be someone else &ndash; and you don&rsquo;t want to be who you are because you got hurt, something happened to you,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>Owens has repeatedly come under fire from the transgender community for expressing similar sentiments in her interviews, including questioning the readiness of modern parents to encourage curious children to transition. Actor Mario Lopez was recently condemned across social media for arguing during an interview with Owens that children as young as three years-old might be too young to decide their own gender.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conservative host has also been slammed for suggesting that the medical community is too quick to diagnose a child as being <em>&ldquo;transgender&rdquo;</em> when perhaps something else could be going on. But Heyer echoes those concerns about medical professionals.</p>

<p>He recounts his own personal experience of visiting a top gender therapist seeking help at the age of 41. Married with two children and a successful career, Heyer was still suffering mental anguish after years of being unable to talk about his past. After only two sessions, the therapist prescribed hormones and wanted him to approve reassignment surgery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Don&rsquo;t let them tell you that they go through some exhaustive psychological counseling because it&rsquo;s absolute baloney &ndash; they just approve, approve, approve, affirm, affirm, affirm &ndash; give them hormones, give them surgery. It&rsquo;s an assembly line.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heyer ultimately divorced his wife, underwent surgery and was fired from his job.</p>
<p>The comments sound provocative at a time when society teaches that the only acceptable response to a questioning or confused child is to immediately support their decision to live as another gender. He is not looked upon kindly among trans activists, who say that, while he may have been misdiagnosed as transgender while actually suffering from a <em>&ldquo;dissociative disorder,&rdquo;</em> that is not the case with all trans individuals.</p>
<p>Yet, Heyer is not alone in some of his conclusions. Others have warned of the dangers of pumping kids full of hormones and using surgery as a drastic quick-fix to a problem which may be more layered and complicated.</p>

<p>In the UK, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) recently <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/464888-doctors-warn-puberty-blockers-danger/">cautioned</a> that there is a lack of <em>&ldquo;robust evidence&rdquo;</em> about the long-term impact of puberty-blocking drugs and hormones given to trans-identified kids. Whistleblower Dr. Kirsty Entwistle, who&rsquo;d previously worked at the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), has said <em>&ldquo;traumatic early experiences&rdquo;</em> &ndash; including sexual abuse &ndash; can lead a child to present with gender dysphoria, but doctors are refusing to fully investigate these cases for fear of being labelled <em>&ldquo;transphobic.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Addressing the high suicide rate among those who have completed the surgical transition, Heyer blames what he believes is the realization that they can <em>&ldquo;never&rdquo;</em> really fully become another gender, which results in further depression.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>It&rsquo;s insane to treat depression with hormones and surgery, but that&rsquo;s what they do.</strong></em></p>

                            <p><strong>In a scarcely believable display of extreme incompetence or bald-faced lying, ABC News has broadcast footage from a Kentucky gun show, claiming it shows a Turkish assault on Kurdish civilians in northern Syria.</strong></p>
                            <p>The news organization made the humiliating fumble on its World News Tonight show on Sunday and then again on Good Morning America on Monday. It featured in a package that was heavily critical of US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Slaughter in Syria,&rdquo; </em>the on-screen graphic screamed as anchor Tom Llamas introduced the footage.<em> &ldquo;This video, right here, appearing to show Turkey&rsquo;s military bombing Kurd civilians in a Syrian border town,&rdquo;</em> Llamas said as the tape rolled.&nbsp;</p>

    
                                
    <iframe
         width="560"         height="315"                src="//www.youtube.com/embed/azrjPK1rbmc"
        frameborder="0"></iframe>




<p>There&rsquo;s just one problem, the video wasn&rsquo;t from northern Syria, it was filmed about 6,200 miles (10,000km) away during a gun show at the Knob Creek Gun Range near West Point, Kentucky.</p>
<p>The open air gun range holds the dramatic shows twice a year and they have been immortalized in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmUZ8LM1Jk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">numerous</a> YouTube videos. ABC played a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrH8bClnlzQ&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from 2017</a> in its Sunday snafu.</p>
<p>Viewing the clips clearly shows that it&rsquo;s the same scene but the video has been edited to crop out the audience watching in the foreground.</p>

    
                                
    <iframe
         width="560"         height="315"                src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BrH8bClnlzQ"
        frameborder="0"></iframe>




<p>After broadcasting the fake footage into homes across the US, ABC also uploaded it to YouTube. The video was <a href="http://archive.is/TofHC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subsequently deleted</a> when the massive error came to light.</p>
<p>World News Tonight issued a correction on Monday, saying that ABC News <em>&ldquo;regrets the error.&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve taken down video that aired on &lsquo;World News Tonight&rsquo; Sunday and &lsquo;Good Morning America&rsquo; this morning that appeared to be from the Syrian border immediately after questions were raised about its accuracy,&rdquo;</em> it <a href="https://twitter.com/ABCWorldNews/status/1183772997771026432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ABC&rsquo;s mistake is made even more glaring by the fact that footage from the Kentucky gun show previously went viral in another fake news fail when it was <a href="https://perma.cc/QYZ4-YJ6N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> that it showed Kurdish forces destroying Turkish tanks in January 2018. Too bad ABC don&rsquo;t employ any good fact checkers.</p>

                            <p><strong>President Vladimir Putin came to Saudi Arabia bearing a gift – a Russian gyrfalcon for Saudi King Salman. Falconry is a popular pastime among Saudi royals, though the bird showed a lack of decorum by soiling the palace floor.</strong></p>
                            <p>The Russian president brought the female gyrfalcon to Saudi Arabia on Monday, as he arrived in the country with an official visit. The Saudi King's return gift was a painting.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="ru"><p lang="ru" dir="ltr">Охотничий кречет Альфа - подарок Владимира Путина королю Саудовской Аравии <a href="https://t.co/SnyrYM5IpG">pic.twitter.com/SnyrYM5IpG</a></p>&mdash; Дмитрий Смирнов (@dimsmirnov175) <a href="https://twitter.com/dimsmirnov175/status/1183694687560974336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">14 октября 2019 г.</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

    

<p>The bird is named Alpha, though her new owner might choose to rename her yet.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="ru"><p lang="ru" dir="ltr">Вручили подарки: Королю Сальману - кречета, Путину - картину <a href="https://t.co/3HcLJwpSTu">pic.twitter.com/3HcLJwpSTu</a></p>&mdash; Дмитрий Смирнов (@dimsmirnov175) <a href="https://twitter.com/dimsmirnov175/status/1183753861644869632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">14 октября 2019 г.</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

    

<p>The solemn moment of gift-giving was marred somewhat, though. The blindfolded gyrfalcon, apparently nervous from all the commotion, seemed to suffer a case of irritable bowels right in front of the cameras.</p>

        frameborder="0"></iframe>




<p>The unusual gift fits right in with Middle Eastern traditions, where hunting with birds of prey is one of the favorite pastimes, among the Saudi royals in particular. Some appear to take their hobby way too seriously, with at least one Saudi prince once buying tickets for each of his 80 birds on a commercial flight, while two others got <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/saudi-princes-falcons-russia-362/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">caught</a> during an attempt to smuggle much-sought avians from Russia.</p>

                            <p><strong>Swiss tennis great Roger Federer says he will look to capture his first Olympic singles gold medal when he competes in his fifth Olympics in Tokyo in 2020.</strong></p>
                            <p>Federer, the holder of an all-time record haul of 20 Grand Slam singles titles and an Olympic champion in the doubles, will compete again in the Olympics next summer in Tokyo.<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p>The 38-year-old native of Basel, Switzerland, confirmed he would participate in his fifth Olympic Games in an interview with the Olympic Channel, the official media outlet of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</p>
<p><em>"I've been debating with my team for a few weeks now, months actually, what I should do in the summer time (of 2020) after Wimbledon and before the US Open, and at the end of the day my heart decided I would love to play the Olympic Games again,"</em> said Federer after his exhibition match against John Isner in the Japanese capital.</p>
<p>Federer previously competed in the Sydney, Athens, Beijing and London Games and was twice &ndash; in 2004 and 2008 &ndash; the flagbearer for Switzerland at the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>In 2008 in Beijing, Federer won his only Olympic gold medal to date, winning the men's doubles alongside fellow countryman Stan Wawrinka. He is still seeking his first triumph at the Games in the singles, after falling short in the 2012 finals in London against local favorite Andy Murray.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2016, following his appearance at Wimbledon, he decided to take the rest of the season off in order to nurse his injured knee back to health, and eventually skipped the Olympic tournament in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p><em>"I carried the flag twice for Switzerland in Athens and Beijing as well, I got a gold and a silver so I&rsquo;d love to play again. I&rsquo;m very excited,"</em> he added.</p>
<p>The men's singles final at the 2020 Olympics is scheduled for August 2, just six days before Federer's 39th birthday.</p>

                            <p><strong>Project Veritas has dropped what it claims is a bombshell expose on CNN, including secret recordings of staff at editorial meetings which reveal an “anti-Trump crusade” and "bias” at the highest levels.</strong></p>
                            <p>In the first clip uploaded by PV, a person who is allegedly CNN President Jeff Zucker tells a staff meeting that he wants them to <em>"stay very focused"</em> on President Donald Trump's possible impeachment.</p>
<p>The video also shows Nick Neville, a media coordinator at CNN saying that Zucker has a<em> "personal vendetta"</em> against Trump.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">PART 1: CNN Insider Blows Whistle, Secretly Records Staff, Execs and Network President Jeff Zucker’s &quot;Anti-Trump Crusade&quot; and &quot;Personal Vendetta&quot; Against POTUS.<br><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ExposeCNN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ExposeCNN</a><br><br>Full video uploading now...sign up now to get each new tape first: <a href="https://t.co/kDe3HDdX2r">https://t.co/kDe3HDdX2r</a> <a href="https://t.co/KKfaK6hvgW">pic.twitter.com/KKfaK6hvgW</a></p>&mdash; James O&#39;Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesOKeefeIII/status/1183779313197469697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>In the hours before the release, PV released a clip of Zucker talking about the forthcoming leaks on the 9AM morning call, confirming that their source is still<em> "on the inside."</em></p>
<p>The whistleblower turned out to be Cary Poarch, a satellite uplink technician and contractor at CNN Washington DC bureau whose identity was unknown until now. Poarch said he began to record staff meetings at the network because he <em>&ldquo;didn&rsquo;t see any other option.&rdquo;</em> He decided to wear a hidden camera <em>&ldquo;to expose the bias.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’d like to introduce CNN whistleblower Cary Poarch, who secretly recorded his colleagues for months. We’ll be uploading clips all day and night. Says Poarch, “I did’t see any other option...I decided to wear a hidden camera to expose the bias” <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ExposeCNN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ExposeCNN</a> <a href="https://t.co/kDe3HDdX2r">https://t.co/kDe3HDdX2r</a> <a href="https://t.co/lcIXgY9BPW">pic.twitter.com/lcIXgY9BPW</a></p>&mdash; James O&#39;Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesOKeefeIII/status/1183782395104890885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>The conservative watchdog group had forewarned of the leaks days ago, counting down with teasers and snippets posted on social media.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Keefe had stressed that the whistleblower is not one of PV&rsquo;s undercover reporters, but one of Zucker&rsquo;s own employees. In the clip, Poarch says his role at CNN was a <em>"dream job"</em> that turned into a <em>&ldquo;nightmare.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In one recording, Zucker says he knows <em>&ldquo;a lot of people&rdquo;</em> at CNN are friendly with Republican senator Lindsey Graham, but warns that it's <em>&ldquo;time to knock that off&rdquo;</em> and<em> &ldquo;time to call him out.&rdquo;</em> Zucker blames <em>&ldquo;years of fake news&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;conspiracy nonsense&rdquo;</em> from Fox News for the climate of division in the US. Poarch says the description sounded awfully like what CNN itself was doing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>He was calling Fox News &lsquo;fake news&rsquo; and a &lsquo;propaganda machine&rsquo; and with what I saw, I&rsquo;m like... that&rsquo;s pretty much what CNN was. It&rsquo;s just pumping out propaganda.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poarch said soon after he began the job at CNN, he noticed a<em> &ldquo;strong groupthink that permeated the halls&rdquo;</em> where everyone was <em>&ldquo;on board&rdquo;</em> the anti-Trump train and that other important stories get sidelined by Zucker in favor of more negative Trump coverage.</p>

<p>The expose appears to confirm that it's not just one or two CNN employees who are growing tired of the constant focus on Trump, either.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I hate everything, how everything is like all Trump all the time now. Everyone at my job, everyone at the network complains about it,&rdquo;</em> says Christian Sierra, another CNN media coordinator.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>They hate covering Trump every day.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sierra goes on to admit that CNN&rsquo;s interviews with Democrat are <em>&ldquo;like softballs&rdquo;</em> and that they are<em> &ldquo;tougher on Republicans.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It was like we were at a funeral &mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;people were like, in shock. I wouldn&rsquo;t say they were in mourning, I would say people were in shock,&rdquo;</em> floor manager Mike Brevna says of the atmosphere at CNN the day Trump won the 2016 election.</p>

<p>Project Veritas has become notorious for its exposes of liberal organizations.</p>
<p>In August, the conservative group revealed that Google had created a politically biased <em><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/466513-google-kept-website-blacklist/">"blacklist"</a></em> of undesirable websites based on a <em>"fringe ranking"</em> system. It has also previously recorded Twitter employees <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/415667-twitter-appears-shadow-banning-conservatives/">admitting</a> that the company <em>&ldquo;shadowbans&rdquo;</em> users with right-wing political views.</p>

                            <p>The tournament, which is sanctioned by both the men's and women's European tours and is due to start on June 11 next year, will feature 156 competitors split evenly down the middle by gender and will impact world rankings in both the men's and women's games.</p>

<p>In addition to counting towards world rankings, points will also be allocated towards the Race to Dubai and Ryder Cup for the men, while the women's scores will impact their Order of Merit standings.</p>
<p>Previous mixed tournaments have placed men in competition with women in an abridged format, or had a women's tournament running concurrently to a men's one but this is the first time that both sexes will compete directly against one another in a full-field format.</p>

                            <p><strong>A black hole located within Earth’s Milky Way galaxy is voraciously consuming its neighboring star with such ferocity that it is literally flickering with visible light, in what is perhaps the cosmic equivalent of drooling.</strong></p>
                            <p>The black hole, named MAXI J1820+070, is located roughly 10,000 light years away and is roughly seven times the mass of the Sun (the lowest estimated mass for a black hole is about five Suns).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazingly, researchers managed to capture the star twinkling by using a new high frame-rate technique, which affords a rate of over 300 frames per second. They were able to capture the fascinating data thanks to the HiPERCAM instrument on the Gran Telescopio Canarias and in X-rays by NASA's NICER observatory on the International Space Station.</p>
<p>They could then recreate the stunning phenomenon in video form using the latest modeling software.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The movie was made using real data, but slowed down to one tenth of actual speed, to allow the most rapid flares to be discerned by the human eye,&rdquo;</em> astronomer John Paice, of the University of Southampton and the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, <a href="https://ras.ac.uk/news-and-press/research-highlights/violent-flaring-revealed-heart-black-hole-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As MAXI consumes the nearby star, the black hole is emitting not just a cacophony of x-rays but also visible light radiation, which literally caught the eye of astronomers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The material around the black hole is incredibly bright, with a light output of roughly one hundred suns, because it has been crushed and compressed by a combination of friction, magnetic and gravitational forces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this, the researchers think it may hint at a unifying characteristic of such black holes that might explain just how plasma is produced and maintained in space, a feat which has proven next to impossible for any meaningful amount of time here on Earth.</p>

                            <p>Agreements include the charter for long-term cooperation between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-cartel oil producers. Along with the charter, the two countries have signed a protocol on energy cooperation.</p>
<p>The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), and ESN Group agreed to invest in designing, building, and operating a methanol plant in Russia&rsquo;s Far East, in the Amur region.&nbsp;The plant is expected to have an annual capacity of up to 2 million tons, according to RDIF.</p>

<p>Russia&rsquo;s sovereign fund along with Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Public Investment Fund and German investment group KGAL have agreed to invest $600 million in setting up a joint firm, called Roal, which will lease passenger jets in Russia.</p>
<p>RDIF said Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund PIF will contribute to an investment in NefteTransService (NTS), Russia&rsquo;s major railroad rolling stock operator, worth up to $300 million. RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev praised cooperation with PIF in Russian railroad logistics sector as a <em>&ldquo;testament of close collaboration.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We support the expansion of NefteTransService&rsquo;s business as one of the leading players in the railway logistics market,&rdquo;</em> said Dmitriev.</p>
<p>RDIF, PIF, and the world&rsquo;s most valuable company Saudi Aramco have also signed transaction documents to acquire a 30.76% shareholding in Russia&rsquo;s Novomet, which is one of the leading producers of oil-submersible equipment.</p>

<p>The investment will be completed upon approval from Russia&rsquo;s Federal Antimonopoly Service, RDIF said. This will be the first joint investment of RDIF and Saudi Aramco within the framework of the energy platform, which was created in 2017 with PIF participation for the sake of investing in Russia&rsquo;s energy sector and possibly localizing business in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia afterwards.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;RDIF, in partnership with Saudi Aramco and PIF, will support significant growth of Novomet&rsquo;s business both in Saudi Arabia and other key markets in the Middle East,&rdquo;</em> said Dmitriev.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The company will be able to expand its pipeline of orders for the production and maintenance of equipment and further develop its product line,&rdquo;</em> he added.</p>

<p>Russia and Saudi Arabia have also agreed to the mutual expansion of agricultural and food products exports. The two sides signed a memorandum which, according to the head of the Russian Ministry of Agriculture, Dmitry Patrushev, provides for an increase in the supply of cereals, live animals, livestock products, food, fish products, shrimp, fruits and dates, niche crops, and forage grasses.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Russian companies are interested not only in increasing trade volumes for traditional types of products, but are also ready to expand its range.

<p>The Russian president&rsquo;s spokesman said that, from the very beginning of Turkey&rsquo;s &lsquo;Operation Peace Spring&rsquo;, Moscow has been pointing out that <em>&ldquo;any actions that could hamper or stall the process of political settlement in Syria and further escalate tensions&rdquo;</em> there are <em>&ldquo;absolutely undesirable.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>At the same time, he made it clear that Russia <em>&ldquo;does not even consider&rdquo;</em> a possibility of a potential military conflict with Turkey in Syria. The spokesman said that the two nations have close contacts both between diplomats and the military that would help them avoid such a development.</p>
<p>However, Moscow has also clarified it did not approve of Turkey&rsquo;s plans to occupy Syrian towns as part of its operation. On Monday, the Russian Defense Ministry denied reports that Russia has no objections against a Turkish assault on the Kurdish-held city of Kobani.</p>
<p>The notion had previously appeared in the Turkish media, citing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as well as in Al Jazeera and Western outlets like the New York Times. But the Russian ministry said the issue of Kobani <em>&ldquo;was not discussed&rdquo;</em> with Turkey, and branded the media reports<em> &ldquo;fake.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>His words came amid the news that the Kurdish-led administration in northern Syria allegedly reached an agreement with Damascus for Syrian government troops to be deployed along the border with Turkey. The Syrian Army already moved towards the border, entering the city of Manbij in the northern province of Aleppo late on Sunday, according to some reports.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Turkish Defense Ministry claimed its troops already pushed 30-35km into the Kurdish-held territory &ndash; well beyond its proposed 30km &lsquo;safe zone.&rsquo; Turkey&rsquo;s advances led to an exodus of Kurdish civilians from the area.</p>
<p>The Kurds were also reported to have abandoned the camps where Islamic State&rsquo;s militants were held. Such a development sparked some concerns in Moscow as President Vladimir Putin previously warned that the Turkish offensive could contribute to the resurgence of the terrorist organization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>The New START [Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty] is actually the only agreement that we have to prevent us from falling back into a full-scale arms race. It serves to further reduce and limit strategic offensive arms, that is to limit the entire range of strategic weapons, the entire strategic triad: land-, sea- and air-based combat inter-continental ballistic missile launchers.</em></strong></p>

<p>The agreement between the US and Russia, conceived in the 1980s, has been the cornerstone of international stability and arms control for nearly three decades. Its latest iteration is set to expire in 2021, and, so far, Washington has not responded to Moscow&rsquo;s proposals on how to amend and extend the landmark treaty.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This treaty expires in 2021. To make sure it is extended, we need to be working on it right now. We have already submitted our proposals; they are on the table of the US administration. There has been no answer so far,&rdquo;</em> Putin said, adding that it looks like the US has not decided yet whether it wants to extend the treaty at all.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Washington withdrew from another major arms control deal, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. The move was a<em> &ldquo;mistake&rdquo;</em> on the US&rsquo; part, Putin stated, explaining that even though the agreement only pertained to the US and Russia, while other nations were free to develop such weaponry,<em> &ldquo;it was not worth ruining the deal.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The potential demise of the last major arms control agreement will certainly make the world<em> &ldquo;more dangerous,&rdquo;</em> and cause other, rather unpredictable consequences, the Russian president warned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>If this treaty is not extended, the world will have no means of limiting the number of offensive weapons, and this is bad news. The situation will change, globally. It will become more precarious, and the world will be more dangerous and a much less predictable place than today.</em></strong></p>

                            <p>The country has been struggling to boost its use of natural gas (which produces less greenhouse gas emissions than coal or oil) because many industries and towns are not linked to its gas pipeline network.</p>
<p>According to the country&rsquo;s oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan, companies are investing $60 billion in the network and building new gas import facilities to link all states by mid-2024. <em>&ldquo;I am not talking about potential investment. This number relates to the projects that are under execution,&rdquo;</em> said Pradhan.</p>

<p>The nation&rsquo;s biggest gas utility, Gail, said it was close to completing the 2,660 km (1,660 miles) Urja Ganga pipeline project, which will connect the eastern states of Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha. The pipeline will have a capacity for 16 million standard cubic meters per day (mscmd) of gas. India&rsquo;s overall gas consumption is about 166 mscmd.</p>

<p>The Urja Ganga project will be ready by the end of next year, according to Pradhan. He said the government had started building the northeast gas grid to connect eight states in northeastern India, a region bordering Bhutan, Myanmar, Bangladesh and China. The grid will be ready by 2023.</p>
<p>The minister added that, before the end of government's current term (mid-2024), <em>&ldquo;India will be connected by a pipeline ring that will help transport gas from any corner of India to a demand center.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Most of India's liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals are in the west, which makes it difficult for industries in the east and elsewhere to secure regular gas supplies.</p>

                            <p><strong>A damning report by the New York Times, which accused Russia of bombing four UN-protected hospitals in Syria, is a product of misinformation by Western intelligence services and jihadists, the Russian military said.</strong></p>
                            <p>On Sunday, the leading US newspaper <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/world/middleeast/russia-bombing-syrian-hospitals.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> it had irrefutable proof that Russian warplanes had bombed four sites in Syria, which it knew to be locations of civilian hospitals. The accusation stems from analysis of social media, interviews with witnesses, data provided by local plane spotters and records of communications of the Russian military deployed in Syria. The bombings, which happened on May 5 and 6, are just a faction of attacks on civilian infrastructure, for which Moscow carries responsibility, the newspaper alleged.</p>
<p>Responding to the accusation on Monday, the Russian military said Times report was flawed for several reasons, including failure to explain that Idlib Governorate, where the four alleged bombings took place, lives under rule of brutal jihadists.

<p><em>&ldquo;Gadgets, modern radio scanners, protected notebooks, internet connection are all things that the local civilian population simply cannot afford. They are more interested in daily surviving under the yoke of the terrorists,&rdquo;</em> said Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov.</p>

The newspaper said those observers <em>&ldquo;insisted on anonymity for their safety&rdquo;</em>, but the Russian military says they shouldn&rsquo;t have bothered and identified them as the people behind a <em>&ldquo;combat intelligence system&rdquo;</em> based on equipment developed by a US company called Hala Systems.</p>
<p>The system known as Sentry is a collection of suitcase-sized sensors connected into a network plus an AI-based algorithm, which uses signals from those sensors as well as social media data to analyze and predict airstrikes in Idlib. Hala Systems says it&rsquo;s a for-profit company that develops and operates the system on grants from governments of Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark the United States, and Germany.</p>

<p>Police arrested governor Adnan Ghaith and the Fatah general secretary for Jerusalem, Shadi Mutour, in raids on their homes in east Jerusalem, lawyer Mohammed Mahmud said. The officials were accused of engaging in activity on behalf of the Palestinian Authority in the city.</p>
<p>Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said that <em>&ldquo;two representatives were arrested by police and are being questioned,&rdquo;</em> but did not confirm their names.</p>
<p>PA activities in Jerusalem are barred by Israel, which occupied east Jerusalem in the 1967 Six-Day War and later annexed it in a move never recognized by the international community.</p>]]>

<p>The&nbsp;widespread view is that the 26 bills for the new parliamentary session will struggle to get through the House of Commons, because the government has a working majority of minus 43.</p>
<p>As is the tradition, the prime minister and the leader of the opposition lead all MPs from the House of Commons to the Lords to hear the monarch&rsquo;s speech. While Johnson attempted, during this procession, to exchange some pleasantries with the Labour Party leader, Corbyn kept straight-faced and kept exchanges very short.<br /><a href="https://twitter.com/Julian5News/status/1183694674504179713?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>

<p>The footage of the two ends with Corbyn pulling a hilarious face, full of concern for the camera operator, which was picked-up-on by many on social media, who saw it more as a comment on the Labour leader&rsquo;s feelings towards Johnson.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;He really doesn&rsquo;t want to be sharing that oxygen, does he?&rdquo; </em><a href="https://twitter.com/Brushsmoke/status/1183705660615200768?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> one observer, while <a href="https://twitter.com/imauniqueuser/status/1183694714698194945?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another</a> thought the expressive pose looked like Corbyn had <em>&ldquo;a selfie stick.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>A few eagle-eyed people identified a painting behind Johnson and Corbyn showing a person lying down sleeping and questioned whether it could be Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg &ndash; a reference to the posh Etonian&rsquo;s recent incident that went viral.<br /><a href="https://twitter.com/DaveWardGS/status/1183696299738222592?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>

<p>The government&rsquo;s new agenda included an immigration bill that would essentially end freedom of movement for EU citizens and introduce a points-based entry system for all immigrants.</p>
<p>When it comes to law and order, the government proposes to increase the six-month maximum jail term for foreign offenders who return to the UK in breach of deportation orders.</p>
<p>The speech also included a plan to make people show photographic ID before being allowed to vote under a new measure to prevent voter fraud. Many critics of the proposal claim such a move would prevent people from casting their ballot.</p>

                            <p><strong>Over the past twenty years, the most important and most exciting development in the United States energy sector has been hydraulic fracturing, also referred to as fracking.</strong></p>
                            <p>This controversial drilling technique made it possible for producers to extract oil and natural gas from shale rock, a fine-grained, clastic sedimentary rock, composed of mud that is a mix of flakes of clay and tiny fragments of other minerals. This revelation sparked a veritable&nbsp;boom in US crude production.</p>
<p>In fact, the development was so significant, it made it possible for the&nbsp;US to become the world's largest oil and gas producer.&nbsp;And many speculate that it could even be key in America's energy independence in the coming years.</p>
<p>While there are plenty of misconceptions that surround this modern technology (it poisonous substances the drinking water, or it creates cancer), the largest is that it's actually a recent innovation.</p>
<h2><strong>The Real History Of Fracking</strong></h2>
<p>Surprisingly, fracking can be traced back to 1862. It was during the battle of Fredericksburg VA., where Colonel Edward A.L. Roberts discovered something incredible when firing explosive artillery into a narrow canal that was blocking the battleground. The breakthrough was then described as 'superincumbent fluid tamping.'</p>

<p>On April 26, 1865, Edward Roberts obtained his very first patent, for an &ldquo;Improvement&rdquo; in exploding torpedoes in artesian wells. In November of 1866, Edward Roberts was awarded patient number 59,936, known as the &ldquo;Exploding Torpedo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This removal method was executed by packing a torpedo in an iron case that contained 15-20 pounds of powder. The case was then dropped into an oil well, at a spot nearest to the oil. From there, they would blow up the torpedo by linking the top of the covering with wire to the surface area and then loading the borehole with water.</p>
<p>This creation boosted oil production by 1200 percent from certain wells within a week. Additionally, this new type of extraction led to the founding of Roberts Petroleum Torpedo Company, which charged $100-$200 dollars per rocket, plus a royalty of 1/15 of the profits generated from the product.</p>
<h2><strong>The Birth Of Modern Fracking&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>The very first improvement on fracking didn't occur until the 1930s, when drillers used a non-explosive liquid substitute called acid, instead of&nbsp;nitroglycerin. This innovation made wells much more resistant to closing, boosting productivity significantly.</p>
<p>Although fracking was technically born in the 1860s, the birth of modern hydraulic fracturing began almost 90 years later. In 1947, Floyd Farris of Stanolind Oil and Gas began to study the relationship between oil and gas production output, and the amount of pressurized treatment being used on each well.</p>
<p>This research resulted in the first experiment involving hydraulic fracturing, which occurred in Kansas in 1947. In this trial, 1,000 gallons of gelled gasoline and sand were injected into a gas-producing limestone formation with a deepness of 2,400 feet. This was then followed by an injection of a gel&nbsp;breaker. While this experiment failed to produce a significant&nbsp;production&nbsp;increase, it did mark the beginning of what is now known as fracking.</p>

<p>Despite the failure in the Kansa experiment, the research proceeded. On March 17, 1949, Halliburton performed two commercial experiments; one in Oklahoma and one more in Texas. These outcomes were far more successful.</p>
<p>After achieving speculative success in 1949, the fracking business began to explode. In the 1960s, Pan American Petroleum started to use this drilling method in Stephens area, Oklahoma. And in the 1970s, fracking began to take off in the Piceance Basin, the San Juan Basin, the Denver Basin, and the Green River Container.</p>
<p>This extensive use even garnered the interest of President Gerald Ford. In his 1975 State of the Union address, President Ford promoted the advancement of shale oil sources as part of his overall energy plan to&nbsp;reduce foreign oil imports.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Welcome The Shale Oil Boom</strong></h2>
<p>The fracking revolution is nothing new. It has been around for over a century now. But that doesn't mean it's finished growing. Like the mobile phone, computer, and car, it's been improved upon and reimagined many times over. The question remains: why did this shale oil boom happen so long after the innovation was created?</p>
<p>The correlation of these two charts, which show production trends dating back to the 1990s and price trends dating back to 2000, will help explain why.</p>

<p>It turns out, the biggest catalyst driving the shale boom was a rise in oil prices. If it weren't for higher prices, the capital investment required in the oil and gas sector, wouldn't have ever occurred, and United States oil production would undoubtedly have remained in decline.</p>
<p>In fact, even some of the&nbsp;world's five biggest oil companies&nbsp;have since flooded into shale hotspots around the country.</p>

                        <p>Spain&rsquo;s Supreme Court has issued a European arrest warrant for the former head of Catalonia&rsquo;s regional government, Carles Puigdemont. He now lives in self-imposed exile in Belgium.</p>
<p>In July 2018, the Spanish court dropped a warrant after Germany refused to extradite him.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court on Monday sentenced nine Catalan leaders to between nine and 13 years in prison for sedition over their role in a failed independence bid, triggering protests across the region.</p>
<p>Puigdemont described the prison sentences as an &ldquo;atrocity.&rdquo;</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>It is probably not a huge surprise to some that Khabib Nurmagomedov, the UFC champion who wrestled bears as a boy, is training for his rumored upcoming fight with Tony Ferguson by once again battling with Mother Nature.</strong></p>
                            <p>A video posted to Instagram shows the UFC's 155lb king aggressively swimming against strong rapids in a river in&nbsp;Kizilyurt, a town in Dagestan around 30 miles outside of&nbsp;Makhachkala.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the video, Nurmagomedov performs a front crawl against a current which appears to be pushing him backward with every stroke.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nonetheless Khabib, who is famous for his cardio inside the UFC octagon, appears undeterred and continues fighting gamely against the water.</p>
<p>The video once again highlights the Russian's unorthodox training tactics and comes weeks after he was publicly criticized by animal rights watchdog PETA for what they saw as cruel treatment of animals after videos emerged of Khabib wrestling a muzzled bear which was tethered to the ground by a chain.</p>

<p>While nothing has been made formal as of yet, Nurmagomedov is widely expected to face top contender Tony Ferguson in his next defense of the UFC lightweight championship.</p>
<p>A fight between the two has been scheduled on no less than four previous occasions but each one fell apart for a variety of reasons related to injuries and bad weight cuts.</p>
<p>Ferguson, who has posted an 18-1 record in the last decade, is widely considered to be Nurmagomedov's toughest challenge and often posts similarly odd training videos to social media which show him incorporating dance moves into his preparations, as well as repeatedly kicking a steel a bar in order to "toughen up" his shins.</p>

<p>But whose off-the-wall training regime will prove best? Only a matchup inside the octagon will truly decide, and fight fans across the world are crossing their fingers that the UFC can finally make the bout a reality.</p>]]>
